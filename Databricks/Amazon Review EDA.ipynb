27, 2013</td><td>0804161380</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>In recent memory, strategy guides have become less of a necessity and more of a collector's item.  For every game nowadays there is a guide to accompany it.  Sometimes there's a collector's edition guide as well.  For collector's these are sometimes a lot of fun.  For Zelda fans that enjoy Zelda lore this collection is a fantastic buy.  There is a limited number in print and it's simply amazing to behold.  It's great packaging and actually has things in there specifically for collectors. Before I begin I want to stress that this review won't be going into the content of each guide.  With the exception of the Skyward Sword guide, each of these guides is exactly the same as their standard (and separately released) collector's edition counterpart.  The reason Skyward Sword is not the same is because this copy was revised and expanded upon.  Aside from that, the other five guides are largely unchanged from their original releases.  There are subtle differences but nothing that greatly changes the actual content in the guide. To begin, the guides come packaged in a box that looks like a chest.  When you open it up there are six hardbound guides in there.  The covers all look very similar.  Each one having an embossed Hyrule symbol on them.  The covers and the borders are different on each guide.  The six guides included are for Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, Ocarina of Time 3D, Skyward Sword and the Windwaker HD.  All the guides have gold leaf pages that are shiny when looking at them from the side. There are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves.  The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped.  This seems a little odd.  It's not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging they're already loose.  Considering each original release came shrink wrapped it's a little strange.  Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras.  Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collector's edition guide isn't here.  Likewise, when this particular collection was announced, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds simply wasn't planned for the package.  So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck.  That's no big deal. There are also a couple of things to note here about only a couple of guides.  The first and most obvious is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  Prima NEVER actually released a hardcover edition of this guide.  Ever.  This is the first time that Ocarina of Time 3D players will get to grab this guide in hardcover.  Originally the guide was only in paperback.  This makes the collector's value certainly worthwhile as it means that the guide will have much more limited hardcover run than all the other guides here.  This boxset is more or less your only chance to get it. The second thing of note is that the Skyward Sword guide included here is NOT the same as the one originally published.  It has been revised and expanded.  Even the layout is very different from the original guide itself.  It has been revised and expanded by over 100 pages.  It is almost a completely new guide from the original one that was released.  So yes, this one too is a rarity because you won't have much luck finding it outside of this particular box set. There are a couple of subtle differences between some guides and the originals.  Most notably is the Ocarina of Time 3D guide.  The original guide was around 224 pages and written in three columns.  Here it's 288 pages and is written in two columns.  It's a lot easier to read and a lot cleaner as a result.  Much of the text isn't so cramped.  Some moments in the Ocarina of Time 3D guide pop out a lot easier.  It just looks better and more organized overall.  The Legendary Checklist in the Ocarina of Time Guide is also better looking.  The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes.  Likewise, the Legendary Checklist in the Twilight Princess Guide is A LOT easier to read and A LOT less cramped.  In the original guide the entire checklist was on a single page with just the location.  Here it's expanded to be in a table format, the font is bigger and it now lets you know your first chance to complete it as well as telling you what's required.  The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks guides are virtually unchanged from their initial releases.  The Windwaker HD is pretty much the same as well.  So for those wondering about whether or not they've changed some things from the original guides, the answer is yes.  Quite simply put some of them are a tad easier to read. The set also came with a few bonuses of note.  The first and probably most valuable of all, is that you get a certificate of authentication from Eijo Aonuma that is signed and numbered.  The second is a laser etched metallic bookmark.  For collectors this package is a pretty sweet deal.  It's invaluable.  The only thing I wish we could've gotten would have been to actually get all the extras the guides themselves actually came with.  It is more or less the only thing I feel is missing and keeping it from being a complete package.  Part of what made the guides collector's editions aside from the hardcovers was actually getting little bonuses that didn't come with the guide otherwise. Nevertheless, for the fan of Zelda this is a good buy.  But let's be clear.  If you are buying this, chances are it is probably not to actually utilize the guides themselves.  After all, many of the games these guides are for have been out for a while and, truthfully, you could just buy them on their own if you really wanted them for strategy.  They are a collector's item.  And it is certainly a nice one.</td><td>A Fantastic Boxset that's Great for Zelda Fans</td><td>1385510400</td><td>1</td><td>1082</td><td>4697</td><td>75</td><td>4.3410351201478745</td><td>14.426666666666666</td><td>0.15944932</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>435</td><td>4.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>07 17, 2006</td><td>B000006OVJ</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Finally, after YEARS of seeing Mega Man in 2D shooter side-scroller gameplay, Capcom began to realize the video game scene was changing, and realism was becoming more important than ever.  So in 1997 Capcom decided to take the classic gameplay of the old Mega Man games and bring Mega Man to an ENTIRE new 3D world.  I finally got to experience the 3D Mega Man adventure a few days ago, in July 2006.  So it took me NINE years to finally play it!  What can I say?  I'm slow! I have a few problems with certain parts of the game but overall, I'm happy to report that the jump to 3D was a good one (not to mention a NECESSARY one!)  Mega Man spends the entire time in Legends jumping and shooting through a unique 3D environment. I'm surprised so many people hate the graphics in the game.  They're quite wonderful if you ask me.  Sure, the graphics may be dated because the game is nearly 10 years old (and walking around in Mega Man Legends is sort of like walking around in a giant land of legos) but none of that should matter because you have to take into account the amount of FUN a game provides.  Mega Man Legends provides a LOT of fun. I really loved one of the very first boss fights in the game where I had to keep running and hiding behind buildings because these giant walking blue, red and yellow machines were throwing bombs and shooting laser beams at me.  The first time I completed this battle it took a good 30 minutes ONLY for a bigger, badder machine to come in and defeat me in seconds.  At first I was angry because the game wouldn't let me SAVE before fighting this fourth boss.  \"A half hour of work flushed down the toilet\" was the thought that went through my head. That led me to think the game might be too hard for me to handle, but it turned out I just didn't have the right upgrades for my X-buster equipped (actually I didn't have ANYTHING equipped!) so when I went back to do the battle again I defeated him (her, actually) rather easily. Most of the enemies throughout the game are rather easy to defeat (including the boss fights).  Many of the boss fights will keep you on your toes, though.  The strategy to defeating many of them is to KEEP RUNNING and only turn around when the moment is right and BLAST them!  The only boss who isn't easy is the very last boss (who sounds like Michael Jackson) because he has TWO forms.  The first form you can figure out with practice, but on the second form he turns into a giant machine and THEN the challenge increases.  But it's possible to find enough money to carry up to 10 Sub-tanks to help you out DRASTICALLY.  If you were to carry 10 Sub-tanks he would be a VERY easy boss!  Despite that, the game provides a nice challenge because the way the story unfolds forces you to do a LOT of things.  You have to go HERE, you have to go THERE!  You have to collect THIS, you have to collect THAT!  You'll find out just how many items and weapons are in the game when you hit the Start button and see everything in your inventory.  It's borderline INSANE. You see, to help make the game easier, what you have to do is go around searching for things (things located in treasure chests or holes in walls) and then you have to bring the things you collect back to this yellow vehicle where your female friend (or sister, I forget who she is) will be inside.  She can find ways to turn many of the things you collect into important weapons for you to use.  She must be smart! I think I explained myself correctly, there.  It's kind of confusing because there's so many things you have to collect and that's the main reason I can't give the game a perfect 5-star rating.  TOO MUCH!  In Mega Man Legends you will find SO many weapons and SO many upgrades that it can easily confuse someone (like me) who's normally not exposed to this much activity in a video game. You have to find a little dancing monkey to save your game.  When you're lost, he can also help you by telling you where to go, unfortunately many times he doesn't provide enough information.  So you can be left wandering around for hours until you finally have no choice but to find a strategy guide on the internet to help you out. The music in the game is nice.  It's usually played quietly which is odd because most Mega Man music is RIGHT in your face.  If you can actually hear the music, it's pretty much what you'd expect from a Mega Man game. Listen to those sound effects!!  Sound familiar?  Think South Park!  One of the children (or \"pirates\") sounds JUST like Butters, and a newswoman who appears later in the game sounds like Kyle's mom!  Some of the animation looks like South Park, too.  When did South Park come out?  1997?  Hmmm, makes you wonder... Once again, the graphics.  They aren't as bad as I thought they'd be.  Sort of blocky, of course (since this IS Playstation ONE we're talking about here) but I can't bring myself to really hate the graphics because there's a certain mysterious charm about them.  Mega Man Legends LOOKS like a children's game but it's not, really.  Most children wouldn't be able to complete the game because some boss strategies require careful timing and it would be difficult for a child. The play control... goodness.  It's definitely not easy to figure out at first.  To make Mega Man walk straight, you have to hold down the L and R buttons (this rotates the direction Mega Man is facing) while at the same time you have to use the up, down, left and right buttons to make Mega Man walk forward.  So, because you have to do a lot of running in Mega Man Legends, when an enemy is chasing you and RIGHT behind you, you have to turn around, use the L and R buttons to face him, and THEN hit him.  In the middle of hitting the L and R buttons will probably be the time you take the most hits.  It may take a few hours to properly pull off but you *should* become better at it with practice. A trick to help you: when an enemy is chasing you, run as far away from him as possible and THEN turn around.  Usually the enemy will be far enough away that you will have time to control Mega Man so he's facing the enemy directly.  Then, simply wait for the enemy to get close and fire away!  I wouldn't blame you if you couldn't figure out the controls- it's not the greatest way to control a character.  I'm not sure if Capcom improved the play control in Mega Man Legends 2. I find it funny and insulting that when you find a hole in a wall, many times a *very* small amount of money will be located there.  Small enough to not be able to afford ANYTHING.  It's funny because Capcom made it like \"wow, you found money!\" only to insult you with sofa cushion money.  To find a LOT of money you have to run around shooting enemies. Just running around shooting enemies and collecting zenny (money) is a lot of fun, not to mention addicting.  A pretty good game worth picking up.</td><td>Mega Man in 3D</td><td>1153094400</td><td>1</td><td>1339</td><td>5519</td><td>61</td><td>4.121732636295743</td><td>21.950819672131146</td><td>0.06679526</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>496</td><td>2.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>01 31, 2005</td><td>B000006OVK</td><td>N.

It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses, and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature, the graphics are painfully watered down, the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates, and there is loads of slowdown.

Let me state right away: graphics in a WWE wrestling game mean absolutely NOTHING to me.  The graphics in WWF War Zone are pretty good (and original, back in the day) but who cares?  It seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic, and their movements true to life.  Who cares?  When War Zone first hit the scene in the late 90's yeah, the graphics WERE cool.  Not now, especially when the only thing the WWE cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism. You know, WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3D level.  A whole new level of crap.  You see, it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same.  Let me explain why this is a bad thing. You know when you buy an updated sports video game (such as football or hockey) and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names, and maybe some new options here and there?  That's exactly what the WWE has done with their video games.  For the last 10 years all the WWE games have been WAY too similar to each other, and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game. It doesn't matter if it's Smackdown, Smackdown 2, WWE Raw for the Xbox, WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube, etc.  Those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism.  I'm all for realism, but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game.  A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it.  And I can't have fun with a wrestling game released today that, more or less, is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago.  It makes me sick to think 10 years later, hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games. Before WWF War Zone, you had WWF In Your House which, to this day, is a game that completely stands apart from other WWE wrestling games (along with WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game).  Before those games you had the button-smashing delight of WWF Raw on the Super NES and Sega Genesis.  Once again, the formula in those old-school wrestling games didn't stick around and overstay its welcome.  Over 10 years with games just like WWF War Zone IS too much. The very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N64, it all went wrong.  Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games, so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realistic-looking gameplay and wrestler appearances, and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach.  It's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing.  After a while you get sick of it. WWF War Zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights, but it was the WORST thing that could have happened.  Graphically, WWF War Zone is the first of its kind.  Being the first means it's bound to have some flaws (despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw!)  Another MAJOR problem with the game is how SLOW it is.  After the adrenaline-rushing WWF In Your House, we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring VERY slowly.  Painfully slow, in fact.  Going from WWF In Your House to WWF War Zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race.  Your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game.  To be fair, the ONLY thing WWF wrestling games today have improved is the speed.  Everything else is the same as it was 10 years ago. WWF War Zone also started the popular \"create a wrestler\" mode.  But it doesn't matter because, as I mention above, wrestling games for 10 years have had that option.  It's an option that has lost its charm because of overkill, and it's time game companies got rid of it, or did something to drastically change it.  It was a fun and interesting idea at first but now, 10 years later, I don't want to have it in a wrestling game ever again. I tried getting rid of WWF War Zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it, so I had to get rid of it by throwing it away.  No way was I keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with MUCH more deserving Playstation games. If only WWE was more innovative with their wrestling games today, instead of repeating the same formula every year, I wouldn't have to keep going back and pointing out WWF War Zone as the game where the downfall began.  After 10 years, updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers doesn't get the job done.</td><td>the absolute low point</td><td>1152748800</td><td>0</td><td>907</td><td>3806</td><td>43</td><td>4.196251378169791</td><td>21.093023255813954</td><td>-0.036898654</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>818</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>08 2, 2006</td><td>B00000DMB4</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Lara Croft games have NEVER been any good.  I remember when the very first one came out 10 years ago.  Teens were practically DROOLING on their controller every time they saw Lara's pretty face.  Tomb Raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin' market.  The thing is, the games are boring and Lara Croft isn't very pretty. If polygon-breasted girls are your thing, go for it.  But they aren't MY thing, and I know I'm not the only one to think so.  Lara Croft isn't good-looking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blocky-looking computer babe isn't going to automatically make a game any fun to play.  I'll give Lara Croft SOME credit.  She was one of the originators of the \"running around half-naked female shooter/adventure\" type of video games.  In fact, you might even say she was a MAJOR influence because soon after her very first adventure, more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games half-naked chicks.  Lara brought something new to the world of video games and I will give her credit for that. Sometimes influence doesn't matter when a game is really bad.  This is one of those cases.  The Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation is a joke.  I absolutely *groan* when I think about playing a Tomb Raider game because I remember how ugly and dark the environments are, the glitchy problems that dominate all three Tomb Raider games, the annoying and difficult jumping style of Lara Croft (which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game.  Good luck- she NEVER jumps where you want her to) and of course, mentioned above, Lara's supposed beautiful face (she's NOT pretty, remember?) It also doesn't help that the puzzles you have to solve are ALWAYS really awful (and appear frequently) and, because of the jumping problem, very frustrating to complete.  Trying to aim your gun at an emeny isn't exactly a walk in the park, either.  The whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point. By the time Tomb Raider 3 was released people were REALLY getting fed up with the series.  Now, these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more Tomb Raider games, but I actually think people got sick of Tomb Raider because games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill came along with a similar style and improved on it *drastically*, making Tomb Raider look awfully dated by comparison. At least the third Tomb Raider game has SOME decent-looking background levels.  I guess the company who created Lara Croft finally understood that Lara's pretty face ALONE isn't going to get the job done anymore.  I mean, at least in some places the backgrounds LOOK good .  Not exactly the prettiest environments available on the Playstation of course, and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight.  But what's THERE is okay to look at, at least. Tomb Raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above-mentioned jumping problem.  She simply doesn't jump the way you want her to.  You'd THINK the game company would've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game, but no, none of these new moves make the game any easier.  The artifact-finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it. BOY am I glad I never bought any of these games (all these years I've been watching OTHER people play them).  Reading reviews for the more recent Tomb Raider games on the Playstation 2, I see NO improvements have been made.

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment. Talk about a video game that not only doesn't live up to the hype (not even close) but it doesn't do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype. This is a serious letdown of a video game. But again, please understand I'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game. I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else. Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series. One thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule, despite being presented as beautiful (and realistic- don't tell me Nintendo wasn't riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here) it's basically a gigantic piece of nothingness. Simply a means of getting from one area to another. A large, colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across. Nothing magical, medieval or interesting about *any* of this. It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house. Going into this game after a Link to the Past, you'll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies, pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles. Remember all those trees, rocks, grass and water sections from Link to the Past? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked? Ha, nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld. Oh sure the monsters come out at night (in predictable spots) but that's it. As far as I can see, only one monster actually comes out (named Stalchild). Terribly lacking. The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too. The dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it's almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient. Again, where ARE all the enemies? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I'm really inside a castle now? Give me a break guys. The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever. Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner, these castles are alarmingly empty, lifeless and unacceptable. But... that's apparently okay, because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels, right? Not in my world baby. The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust. While normally I don't care about graphics in a video game, you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing. This is just... gross. Only the realistic-looking (flawed) overworld is a sight to behold (which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess). Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn't much to admire. I don't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings, trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64's datedness. Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or, at the very least, forgiving. What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction, or having a game entirely too long so we're forced to persevere these issues time and time again. In other words I'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas. Sadly, it doesn't. This isn't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have (which I'll mention below- keep reading). These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series. The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and cannot be compared to any other game. Let's discuss the dungeons, shall we? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings, most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it's almost a chore going through one generic room after another. Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead. When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you're doing and where you're going, it's enough to make you think you're playing with string puppets. Again, early 3D design flaws and datedness. The storytelling is really basic and predictable. It's never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. It's mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron's for the first half, and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half. This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented. It doesn't even feel or look like you're going 7 years into the future as Link's appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he doesn't appear to be much different from his younger self. Oh sure he's slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it's very subtle. The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however. All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments, but melodic and memorable. Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting. The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game. The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and won't get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there. The dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches, or hopelessly generic \"I'm stuck in a maze and I can't get out\" frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design. But... these aren't any ordinary mazes. These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn, hence the flawed early 3D game design. A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be, or in other words, needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda's so memorable. Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means, and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door. Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins. The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever. The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration. The enemies, or rather, what little enemies you will stumble upon on your \"adventure\" through the temples, is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game. These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable. You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy. Why even have a sword? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and, guess what? *Now* the dungeons are exciting. A genius idea really. Here? In Ocarina of Time? It's all about atmosphere. It's all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo's most recent creation back in 1998. But... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day. What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design. Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable. That's exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it hasn't stood the test of time. Do you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game? Seriously? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64's limitations as a console that it's unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link. But even then, *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable. Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it's more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you're running around. The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting. Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable. Ever! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously, seriously. Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make, Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire, and Gibdos are boring. The ReDead's let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you're trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you're stuck in a room with two of them. Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them, run behind them, and slice them with your sword. To be fair, some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it's best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there. The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat. And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies. The game overall has a shortage of rupees. They're really not that important which is odd. This is the first Zelda game I've ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought. Not something to take real seriously. If you don't feel like collecting them, then don't- no harm done. The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon. You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform. It takes FOREVER (and no, this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you're wondering). The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often. The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations, but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas. After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens, you get a beneficial reward. You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy (usually found on walls). I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple. While the temple itself is really short and boring, it's probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight. You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch, and it's really fun and creative. The hookshot's basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it's annoying that it's used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game. Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot, using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while (especially if you keep missing your target) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot. If you haven't noticed yet, the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable. I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way. Also, the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons (mostly for warping from one place to another). Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times. It's overdone. Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake. Don't make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times, if not more. I never really counted how many times I used it. It was a lot. It severely drags the gameplay, atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina. Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I've ever seen. No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days. This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence. Ganon's castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful. It's supposed to be filled with dangerous traps, tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place. But... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards. Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier. The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees. This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening. Another bonus point for Link to the Past. Oh and the Ganon fight? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim's battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down. Remember how you fought Agahnim? Yup, same exact strategy but in a 3D world. Sigh. The second part of the Ganon fight (after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times. It's really easy, all of it. However fighting him in one of the early dungeons (Forest Temple) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series. This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept. Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie. A few other complaints. Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy. It's better than most fishing games I've played in other games I admit. Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however. Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them. That's a rare compliment I can give. Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun. I don't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm. If you fall behind even a *little* bit you'll lose. Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you're dodging fireballs. The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based. Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times. This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting. Basically, when compared to the 2D games, Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what's available in Link to the Past. As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions. It's because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that's really only able to handle so much. Ocarina of Time comes up way short. Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going. Avoiding being detected by guards isn't fun after the first time. Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people. The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon. Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters, these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen. The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them. At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times, and they fall over and die. Reading text and having boring discussions with Zelda, trees and other semi-interesting characters doesn't get the job done either. Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual (that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here). I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating. The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here. Otherwise, Ganon's presented uninterestingly. You're *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems, Ganon being a ruthless villain doesn't ever materialize (at least, he's not as scary as he *should* be). Recognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist. That's fair. It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now. By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories (gameplay, graphics, replay value and excitement). I say avoid Ocarina of Time but hey, nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day!</td><td>a 2-star rating- I seriously can't give it a higher star</td><td>1374796800</td><td>0</td><td>3166</td><td>15132</td><td>181</td><td>4.779532533164877</td><td>17.49171270718232</td><td>0.019215262</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>936</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>08 12, 2013</td><td>B00000DMAQ</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Banjo-Kazooie is a strange platformer, but ultimately misses the mark in all key areas of being entertaining.  It tries to be funny without actually being exciting to play so the game feels like a big misleading tease.  All the attention on humor and yet, the game itself is hardly ever fun.  This means children would probaly be able to overlook the games flaws and focus on the humor, which I'm sure was Nintendo's intentions- to market the game for kids and assume they wouldn't be able to detect the lousy game design.  I guess the Nintendo 64 struggling to make a profit at the time meant Nintendo had to do absolutely anything and everything to try and get *any* type of crowd interested in their products despite the poor quality we're forced to persevere, so that explains Banjo-Kazooie's existence. Anyway, Banjo-Kazooie is basically nothing but an item-collecting quest with graphics that are admittedly prettier and just better than 90% of the stuff the N64 was pumping out at the time.  The waters, grassy lands, mountains... everything is a beautiful sight to behold with crystal clear authentically pleasing environments.  Probably on par with Donkey Kong 64 in terms of graphics but definitely NOT in terms of gameplay or the sheer size of the overworld which is incredibly tiny in Banjo-Kazooie.  But seriously, why am I basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time?  If you think \"That's what ALL platformers do!\" guess again: many of them focus on exciting enemy variety, diverse surroundings and a gradual increase in challenge which this game sorely lacks.  The only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes- these are dirty tricks and artificial challenges.  I found sharks you have to swim away from, crabs you can stomp on top of, and weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while you're trying to make your way across high paths without falling.  These enemies only appear like 10% of the time- the rest of your surroundings aren't very threatening. Let's see all the things you have to collect.  Honeycomb pieces, jiggy pieces (mandatory to open entrances to new locations and you need to obtain a certain number of them per world), 100 musical notes which is a total ripoff of Super Mario 64 with the 100 coins needed to get a star, mumbo tokens used to cast spells, and jinjo tokens used to win vehicle parts.  You can turn into animals and insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity, but otherwise nothing to get really excited about.  Often you have to climb trees or mountains to reach the items on top and it gets boring after a while, believe me.  The snowy and dessert areas are incredibly generic too, as are the underwater cave sections and grasslands. Oh and the game is a victim of underwater tragedies- you're constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that it's much harder than it needs to be.  I will never understand why Nintendo refuses to fix water portions in 3D platform gaming.  It's mind-boggling.  They didn't even fix them in Super Mario Galaxy 2, a game released a good 10 years after Banjo-Kazooie.  The characters are all forgettable, including the ponytail-sporting female bear and Banjo himself.  Kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunch. Whereas the Mario series can be enjoyed by kids and adults respectively, Banjo-Kazooie is certainly intended solely for children and no other age group.  It's too shallow of a game overall to satisfy adult gamers.  Banjo-Kazooie is like walking into the nicest looking restaurant in town and everything is great except for one thing- you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself \"Is it worth my time to return here again?\"</td><td>banjo kapooie</td><td>1376265600</td><td>0</td><td>668</td><td>3158</td><td>29</td><td>4.727544910179641</td><td>23.03448275862069</td><td>0.052449625</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>1086</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>11 27, 2010</td><td>B00000DMAX</td><td>Ryan Sil.

In this game, you play any of eight characters in 16 traditional courses and 4 battle zones. Choose from Mario, Yoshi, Wario, Peach, Luigi, Toad, Donkey Kong, and Bowser. The graphics are a bit more intact than the other racing games that came later for the system. Although it might try to drown you out a little bit at a time, when you complete the four racing cups quickly. Luckily, the game truly makes up for it in the Vs. mode, where you are head-to-head n a battle with up to four players in the race.

As you may have heard, I am definitely NOT a fan of the very first Crash Bandicoot game released for the Sony Playstation in 1996.  I am, however, incredibly surprised to find that Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is actually a really fun adventure game that may have been slightly overlooked at the time of its release because of the seemingly never-ending amount of wonderful games released for the Playstation in 1998. Just so you know, I can't compare Warped to Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back because I haven't played that one.  I can only compare Warped to the original Crash Bandicoot. Before playing Crash 3, I was almost CERTAIN that Crash Bandicoot was an overrated video game character because my first and only exposure to Crash was the very first game.  I thought for sure Crash Bandicoot was either a Mario or an Earthworm Jim rip-off, and didn't deserve all the attention it got. For 10 years the original was the only Crash Bandicoot game I knew, and truth be told, it was a pretty average game because every stage featured basically the same uninspiring, repetitive island environment where the object was to run to the end of every stage collecting berries and smashing all the boxes as a way to earn more lives and receive a better overall percentage. Simply put, Crash's very first outing was BORING.  It desperately needed variety.  Walking through island/jungle stages all the time can only provide so much fun before it inevitably gets boring.  The creators of Crash Bandicoot must have realized how boring this formula was because Warped does just the opposite- Warped features nothing BUT creativity.  In Warped every stage certainly does NOT have the same feel.  You will encounter something drastically different in every stage.  I like that. The main objective of Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is to find the purple gem found in each of the 25 stages of the game.  You HAVE to find all 25 purple gems otherwise the game won't allow you to fight the boss at the end of the world you're in.  For example, if you're in World 4, and can't find the purple gem in stage 3, you won't be allowed to face the boss at the end of that world.  You're stuck there until you find that darn purple gem.  Once you find the gem, and face and defeat the boss, you move on to the next world and repeat the process of collecting one purple gem per level and face the boss.  By the way, there's 5 worlds total and 5 stages in each world.  That comes to 25 stages total. The amount of creativity that went into each of the 25 stages is simply incredible.  Unlike the first Crash Bandicoot game where you mainly just spin around through a jungle environment breaking boxes and jumping over cracks in the ground, Warped offers a LOT more in the way of variety.  In Warped you will encounter a few motorcycle racing stages (where you're required to get first place so you can receive the purple gem), a couple underwater stages (with VERY neat-looking backgrounds and deadly, puffy fish swimming about), a couple levels where you're steering an airplane and required to shoot down blimps and other airplanes, and not to mention those tricky, tiger-riding stages. Oh, and I HAVE to mention the ultra-cool futuristic robot stages (which require near-perfect jumping patterns in order to complete).  The Jet Ski stages are really fun because you're located on top of the ocean and I guarantee you will have the time of your life jumping over ramps while avoiding those floating bombs.  Yup, it's awesome.  This is what makes Crash Bandicoot 3 so great- you won't know WHAT to expect until you enter the level. Probably the worst thing about Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is the fact that the game offers little in the way of challenge.  That's not to say the game is a cakewalk, either.  People who think Warped is an easy game are only comparing the challenge to the previous two Crash Bandicoot games.  If you compare Warped to say, I don't know, Spyro the Dragon, it's not such an easy game then.  It's definitely not a hard game either.  You WILL beat it.  I think the challange is comparable to Super Mario Bros. 1, the old NES classic. The one thing I find challenging in Warped is the boss battle in World 3 where you're required to jump over bombs and laser beams heading in your direction.  This is one case where practice doesn't necessarily make perfect.  Also the second airplane stage can be a challenge if you don't bother shooting down the enemy planes. One thing about Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped that IS incredibly easy is the object of finding those purple gems.  Most of the time you can NOT miss those gems, because you basically walk right into them on your way to reaching the end of the stage.  I mean, they are always RIGHT THERE.  RIGHT in front of you! After you complete a stage, you can always go back to it and the computer will then give you a new option to complete the level in a certain amount of time.  Finishing the stage in a certain amount of time is actually quite hard.  It means you *really* have to take off running and not stop for a single moment to smash a box or spin-attack an enemy or ANYTHING.  It means you have to run run RUN!  Just so you know, completing the stages under a certain time is NOT a requirement.  It's entirely up to you if you'd like to accept the challenge.  I'm too much of a wimp to accept it, personally. I like how you can save your game after you complete a stage.  You can actually complete one stage and go to the save room, if you wish.  Very convenient.  Oh, and get this- if during the middle of the game you decide you want to stop playing and shut off the Playstation, when you come back to the game later all the lives you collected up to that point will STILL be there!  I can't think of any other game that will save all the lives you collect.  Speaking of lives, they are *so easy* to find in Warped that you probably can collect up to 45 of them.  That's a lot, and you will probably need them because, even though the challenge ranges from low to medium, your first time through the game won't be THAT simple. When Crash gets hit or smashed by something, I think it's funny the way he yells \"whoa!\"  It reminds me of that comedian Carrot Top. The reason Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped isn't going to receive a 5-star rating from me is because of the same problem found in Spyro the Dragon- in the flying stages (in this case, the airplane stages) when you hit down on the D-pad the airplane flies UP, and hitting up will make the airplane go DOWN.  The game company made the direction the wrong way!  Oops.  At least when you steer the airplane left, it will go left.  The same with right.  Unfortunately, many game makers have made, and continue to make, the same mistake.  It needs to be corrected once and for all. I realize having your airplane fly up when you hit \"down\" on the d-pad is an example of realism since that's more or less how REAL airplanes operate, but the thing is, Crash Bandicoot isn't supposed to be about realism since it's just a platform adventure game, and furthermore, it still doesn't change the fact that up and down are reversed.  This adds unncessary frustration and challenge in learning something that definitely feels backwards. There's a toxic underwater stage in Donkey Kong Country 3 where the controls are reversed as a way to add challenge, and in my mind at least, having the controls reversed when trying to operate the airplane in this game definitely falls under the same category of unnecessary challenge. I hope you buy this game for your Sony Playstation and experience a fun time.</td><td>Crash's best game</td><td>1156118400</td><td>1</td><td>1437</td><td>6293</td><td>67</td><td>4.379262352122478</td><td>21.44776119402985</td><td>0.01745438</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>1362</td><td>4.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>12 12, 2002</td><td>B00000DMAV</td><td>N.

Super Mario 64 plays how a 3D game should be played like: With a free camera, flawless control, and extremely playable environments. Getting all 120 stars is the real challenge.

It's not.  Just because it's significant and influential in helping pave the way for future Mario titles doesn't mean Super Mario 64 is deserving of its classic status, or that it's any fun to actually play.  Super Mario Galaxy came along and pretty much improved every single aspect of Super Mario 64 so you basically no longer have to play this game other than to get a dated taste of mid 90's gaming history.  The only other possible reason someone would play Super Mario 64 is because they desperately seek open world exploration, and this is basically the only Mario platformer that can at least attempt to satisfy gamers with that particular appetite.  Not that I personally believe the game succeeds at the exploring aspect either. The biggest problem is that so much of the land you explore consists of emptiness.  Oh sure you'll see trees, ramps, castles, buildings, enemies such as goombas, chain chomps, badly and laughably animated thwomps lifting up and slamming down, pokeys, rolling boulders, and other things that have become a trademark of the Mario series, but the amount of items to find and collect is *extremely* limited to coins (both yellow and red ones) and the occasional power-up that enables Mario to either fly (which admittedly is pretty fun) or obtain the incredibly boring metal cap that makes Mario invincible.  An alternative to the starman perhaps, with lousy side effects (Mario can't jump as high or far while wearing the metal cap). When you're not experiencing the endless disappointment that is running across empty and boring lands and basically doing nothing but wasting time, you're jumping across a series of unspectacular and very ordinary-presented platforms over and *over* again.  This stuff seriously resembles a beginners course for developing platforms.  It's extremely basic game design.  The platforms are generic square-shaped tiles for you to jump across that quite often are all the same exact size.  It gets monotonous almost immediately.  Only unreasonable Nintendo fans would eat this stuff up, seriously.  Anybody else would obviously be able to detect flawed, repetitive gameplay.  The 2D Mario games move at such a swift pace that you don't even have time to stop and notice the platforms (unless you're an extremely slow gamer).  This is mainly because you don't have to stop and situate Mario a certain way for the purpose of making the perfect jump which is what severely ruins Super Mario 64's gameplay.  And don't EVEN say my skills are horrible when it's obvious through countless youtube videos that several gamers have the same exact issue. While I'm by no means someone who cares about the best graphics available, you gotta admit the ones here have dated horrendously with embarrassing blocky shapes pretty much occupying most areas of the game.  The buildings, water and trees in particular are just awful for the eyes.  Nothing appealing whatsoever about any of the graphics- even the bright inviting colors don't lure me in but rather rub me the wrong way and force some of us older gamers to recall the unpleasant days of Mario Paint. You have to collect 120 stars in order to complete the game 100% but guess what?  Many of the stars are flat out boring to collect due to being pathetically easy and basically being handed to you within minutes.  What kind of challenge is that?  The one where you have to swim around and open treasure chests in a certain order is baby-ish, and the one where you swim around collecting 8 predictably located red coins inside a basic building near the beginning of the game is offensive.  Or how about simply stomping a post into a ground to release a gate and thus, release the star?  Don't even *think* about mentioning the ones where you walk up to Toad and he simply hands you the star.  Granted, the game seems to always alternate easy star-collecting challenges with longer and more drawn out ones as a way to balance things out but that's the problem- the stars are either too easy or too long.  There is one star mission so awful it makes your inevitable death seem like something to anticipate- the one where you have to jump across a series of moving poles.  You have to jump at *just* the right moment while making sure you're positioned in the right spot.  This takes forever and is dreadfully annoying. Also, what's up with all the little baby games?  Grab a baby penguin and slide down a snowy hill?  Chase the bunny so he doesn't hop away?  These are not suitable for anyone who recalls the challenging portions of previous 2D gaming such as Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World (and yes, these bunny grabbing missions are flaws in Super Mario Galaxy too, in case you think I'm intentionally favoring Super Mario Galaxy for no reason).  At least the cannon-shooting parts are cool.  It's fun figuring out where to launch Mario so he can land safely on upper grounds. I can't help but feel the red star collecting is overrated.  When you collect red stars in Yoshi's Island, you feel like you're given a really elaborate and perfectly executed assignment since you also have to collect flowers and stars to 100% complete a stage.  It's a lot to do not to mention really darn exciting and satisfying once you've acquired all these items, and constantly keeps your attention span in check while searching for them.  Super Mario 64 basically takes that one red coin-collecting element of Yoshi's Island and makes it a main priority here.  You often have to collect 8 red coins per stage (opposed to 20 in Yoshi's Island) to obtain one of the 120 stars.  Ugh. But nothing NOTHING is worse than the fact you have to re-enter stages over and over again just to grab all the stars that are located throughout.  To me this is unquestionably lazy game design.  How can it be anything else?  Who in their right mind would actually *want* to keep going back to the same exact stage ad nauseam?  Super Mario World was guilty of this too granted but not NEARLY to this exaggerated extent.  A terrible idea that gives a false impression a game has replay value but it's exactly the opposite- once you go through the same stage a bunch of times and finally accomplish everything there is to offer, you won't want to repeat these same objectives ever again.  So... you probably won't want to play Super Mario 64 ever again.  Even worse- when you often have to search for 100 coins to obtain a star.  This can take up to 20 minutes and bore you the entire time.  Being forced to collect 100 coins is a lazy way of assuring gamers don't leave any stone unturned because you basically have to thoroughly search every nook and cranny of a stage to even *find* 100 of them. I also dislike how many of the classic enemies aren't included here such as the hammer brothers, buzzy beetles, bloopers, and cheep cheeps.  Even the koopa troopa is nowhere to be seen (well, other than that one race in the beginning).  You can ride a koopa shell like a skateboard but that doesn't count as an enemy appearance.  He's not a true enemy here.  Why is that?  Why not include all the familiar and well-loved enemies that have become a trademark to the Mario series?  They ruin the pirahna plants by the way.  Why is he sleeping?  Granted he comes alive when you get near, but it's a really weird concept.  At least Nintendo got the boos and haunted house right- a surprising and exciting maze-like high point of the game.  It's a lot of fun sorting through each room of the haunted house stages.  *That's* how you design a memorable stage.  Obviously if you weren't busy running around through several vast and average-designed empty fields of grass, there could have EASILY been room for the inclusion of more enemies.  Hey I'm all for open world exploration, but you have to actually fill in those areas with exciting, creative items that are both fun and rewarding to collect for the player, and enemies that present threatening encounters and a rush of excitement.  Simply throwing Mario into a big 3D world because it's his first grand 3D adventure truthfully isn't going to get the job done I'm afraid.  More needs to be done. Constantly having to rearrange the camera so you can see where you're actually going is a nuisance.  Nobody likes dealing with a camera while jumping around trying to play a video game, but granted, several games back in the mid to late 90's were guilty of the same camera problems since developers were still getting their feet wet so to speak, and figuring out the best way to help players accurately and conveniently see what's ahead.  Still, you'll lose more than a few lives due to bad camera angles in Super Mario 64.  I guarantee it.  One thing I *do* like about this game is how fast Mario runs.  It's a fast-moving game, which helps going from point A to point B more convenient. Also some of the wall jumps and triple jumps are fun to execute.  Reminds me of Super Metroid in that respect.  Yoshi is teased in this game (I won't spoil how) but he's not actually playable which doesn't make sense.  Why make an appearance if he's not going to be playable? The music is either extremely good (the brilliant peaceful moodiness of the water theme and the intimidating and exciting heavy metal-like Bowser fights) or downright horrendous (everything else, which consists of annoying nursery rhyme children's themes inappropriate and painfully skull-smashing for the rest of us).  I can't STAND the theme songs that play in Whomp's Fortress and Rainbow Ride- two unforgivable themes that make me want to smash my brains in whenever I play Super Mario Galaxy 2 where they return in all their overbearingly annoying glory.  Rainbow Ride in particular reminds me of a county hayride where kids ride around on tractors (not to mention the stage itself is extremely tedious and overlong).  The snowy mountain stage with the Italian accordion music is sickening and out of place.  Just mute the volume on your TV to make life easier for yourself.  The boss fights are incredibly simplistic- grab Bowser's tail, spin him around and toss him, or pick up/stomp other bosses.  Basic, boring stuff. A few stages that are actually fun include Lethal Lava Land where the platforms convincingly feel like an upgrade into the 3D world from the original Super Mario Bros. castle levels (not to mention better/more interesting use of platform jumping compared to the rest of the levels in SM64), Shifting Sand Land since it's packed with obstacles and enemies (and reasonably challenging overall), and Tall Tall Mountain's tricky climb to the top (involving a vine climbing portion).  In fact, to be fair, Tall Tall Mountain is one of the best levels ever in a 3D Mario game.  It's *that* good.  Bowser's castle levels are pretty solid as well, mostly due to the fast-paced nature of them. Several things feel tacky- the 1-ups and coins are small, dark, ugly looking, and clumsily made due to less than spectacular graphics and game design, and overall Super Mario 64 is just a really lackluster and highly overrated game.  If not for influence, this game would have been forgotten and the superior Super Mario Galaxy series would have prevailed even more dominantly than they already do.  Oh and don't even mention the cake-eating storyline.  It's atrocious.  The fact they brought it back for the Galaxy series makes me want to vomit.</td><td>Mario's first jump into the land of 3D platforming stinks</td><td>1151280000</td><td>1</td><td>2049</td><td>9370</td><td>90</td><td>4.572962420693021</td><td>22.766666666666666</td><td>0.026975399</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A3W4D8XOGLWUN5</td><td>1520</td><td>4.0</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>10 13, 2002</td><td>B00000F1GM</td><td>Michael Kerner</td><td>Surprisingly, when Nintendo created the N64 game system, they had absolutely no idea of how succesful it would be. The first game that the system ran on was also a scream. It just sometimes comes to me as a surprise that a lot of these newer games that run on CD-ROM like the Playstation 2, and the XBOX may have faster and better graphics, but not likely with the actual loading time. Nintendo's Super Mario 64, remains as the most dynamic staple of any N64 system to date. The graphics are just completely amazing, and so strong from one angle to another. In Super MArio 64, you guide Mario through 15 terrific stages with exciting adventure around every corner. The object of the game is to try collect as many stars as possible that are hidden in the game. Each star is very vital inorder to help you save Peach, whom is still known as Princess Toadstool, from the vile Bowser. Each course takes you from all depths of the secret kingdom, from Sea, to the firey sky, and even in a spooky ghost-filled house. The load up time for this, and every other N64 game is much faster than the CD-Rom games for the PC, and the other CD-Rom console games. It is kind of sad Nintendo stopped making fantastic games on cartridge like this, and traded it for a CD-ROM gaming factory, with the Gamecube. Nevertheless, Super Mario 64 is still the most superior game of the 20th century, and that is not even a pizza-faced lie.</td><td>Mario's Landmark</td><td>1034467200</td><td>1</td><td>259</td><td>1154</td><td>13</td><td>4.455598455598456</td><td>19.923076923076923</td><td>0.09990476</td><td>536</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>1707</td><td>4.0</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>12 25, 2004</td><td>B00000I1C3</td><td>Bryan</td><td>WWF In Your House, while graphically WORSE than WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game, should *not* be ignored if you like that Wrestlemania game because In Your House features the *exact* same arcade wrestling action.  The wrestlers have been updated too. Yes, WWF In Your House is an old game with noticeably average graphics and not-so smooth animations.  It came out in 1996, I believe.  The graphics simply aren't as good as Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game.  BUT if you're a fan of Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game, I see no reason why you wouldn't like In Your House. Some reviewers claim this game is hard.  It's really not that hard once you remember the most effective and damaging moves. It's easier than Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game.  In fact, if you consider yourself a fast gamer, you won't have ANY trouble with In Your House.  There's an option to put the game on easy, so if you must, put the game on easy.  Also turning blocking off helps make the game much easier.  Using the run button that's located at the top of the Playstation controller (I believe it's either L2 or R2, or maybe both) is a MUCH better idea than using the OTHER way of running (hitting two buttons at once- ugh!) The loading time is somewhat worse than Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game, but only somewhat.  In Your House takes maybe 3 or 4 seconds longer to load a match, if that.  Unfortunately, the way Vince McMahon introduces the wrestlers is pretty bland and uninteresting compared to Wrestlemania: the Arcade Game where you actually saw the wrestlers running forward, towards their opponents, featuring their own distinct animations (such as Shawn Michaels posing and Doink \"the clown\" squirting water).  In this game, Vince just SAYS who you're facing while a boring picture appears on screen showing the wrestlers.  It's not as good. You get to play as 10 wrestlers, and each wrestler has his own set of unique moves.  It's better to try finishing off your opponent using the moves that drain the most energy.  That's the number one rule to winning. Going through a World Title tournament in Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game takes about 10 minutes.  Here it takes about 20 minutes, because you have to compete in more matches.  It's not a problem at all, though.  If anything, it's better this way, because it's *so* much fun going through all the rounds and whipping out one devastating move after another.  Some of these moves are realistic, while other moves are too extreme for wrestlers to be able to perform in reality.  For example, the Ultimate Warrior shooting lightning and the Undertaker shooting some kind of demonic spirits at you.  It doesn't happen in real life. You get to play as Shawn Michaels, Vader, Bret Hart, Owen Hart, Ahmed Johnson, The British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith, The Undertaker, Goldust, The Ultimate Warrior, and Hunter Hearst Helmsley.  People may complain that this is a really small list of wrestlers to choose from, but it's actually better than the more updated wrestling games on the market today that feature WAY too many wrestlers that have no reason to exist.  At least with a small selection, you will be able to remember all your opponents main power moves.  Plus, giving you a small list of selectable wrestlers makes it feel more like a short and intense arcade game, which is the point. It's probably the hardest going through the tournaments (all three of them) with Goldust because his energy seems to drain very quickly, and it's probably the easiest to complete these tournaments with Shawn Michaels or the British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith because they have MANY power moves that finish your opponent off very quickly. But as I said above, this game is worse than Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game because the graphics and animations aren't in the same league.  But see, the thing is, In Your House and Wrestlemania: the Arcade Game are the ONLY arcade wrestling games with the WWE logo on them.  This means we only have TWO games like this that exist in the entire world.  Sure beats having a million slow-moving big and bulky 3D WWE games out there that have no major innovations implemented whatsoever to separate themselves, right? I have a lot of fun with these arcade style wrestling games, so realism doesn't matter to me at all.  I will take this game over any and all of the best-looking WWE wrestling games that are so popular today.  I prefer wrestling games that are FAST, and that's what In Your House is all about.  It's fast, exciting, unique and with practice, not very difficult to complete.  Who cares about graphics? So, in short, I don't CARE that In Your House is sort of a low-budget looking WWE game.  This and Wrestlemania are the only games like it. Also, the commentators, Vince McMahon and Mr. Perfect, have a LOT more things to say in In Your House compared to Vince and Jerry Lawler in Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game.  Also worth mentioning: each wrestler has their own special thing to say at the beginning and end of a match.  Okay, so they don't say things ALL the time, but many times they do. Both the Playstation and Saturn versions are great.  The Playstation version has shorter loading times, and plus I think the Playstation controller is better for delivering moves because of the simple button layout.  Also, there's a Sound Test option only in the Playstation version where you can hear all the sound effects and theme songs in the game.  I mean EVERY SINGLE THING you hear in the game can be found in the sound menu!  It's pretty awesome. The Saturn version has a couple things that the Playstation version doesn't have, so don't worry Saturn fans!  Exclusive to the Saturn version includes an extra move for the Undertaker (in this version, you can deliver multiple chokeslams to your opponent - you can't do this on the Playstation version) and plus the Saturn version was created so you can perform finishing moves whenever you want, whereas in the Playstation version they can only be delivered during one-on-one matches.  It doesn't matter how many people you are facing on the Saturn version, you can deliver finishing moves at the end of every match, if you'd like. Either version is great though.</td><td>Come on, In Your House is a fun arcade-like wrestling game</td><td>1103932800</td><td>1</td><td>1103</td><td>5071</td><td>53</td><td>4.597461468721669</td><td>20.81132075471698</td><td>0.092017934</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>1767</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>03 18, 2007</td><td>B00000I1C1</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Twisted Metal 2 was a HUGE game back in the day.

The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window. The other flaw is the level design. Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost. The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where. Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow! When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable. Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting. They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad. The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is. While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it.

Digitized and bloody fighting combined with neck-breaking, spine-ripping fatality moves make the series seem like gold. But I personally find the transition from 2D to 3D for this series scary at first glance. I originally thought the fatalities would end up being like horror movie scenes. However, I ended up sticking with it. In Arcade mode, there were about 5 or 6 difficulty modes. In Mortal Kombat on the SNES, I played well on it. In Mortal Kombat 2 on Game Boy, I was able to tackle Hard mode. In Mortal Kombat 4 for Game Boy, I can beat Master mode, but that version of this game was too easy. Here, I got my butt kicked even on Normal mode! The game is pretty challenging, but I think if a player's good enough, he can whop through easily. The gameplay is traditional Mortal Kombat fighting action. There are also some new moves, such as twisting someone's leg. The graphics are also really great, especially considering some of the Nintendo 64's limits, such as the 2D blood during the Game Over screen. And of course, the sound is top-notch.

It was new, it was innovative.  It had something.  Meanwhile, the Sony Playstation got Crash Bandicoot, and this was described as a game that could take Mario on at his own game.  That, of course, didn't happen, as Mario still holds the torch.  However, Crash Bandicoot wasn't a bad game.  It was, however, a bit more flawed than most other games out there for certain reasons, the main one seeming to be its unforgiving difficulty.  There were, of course, other mitigating factors. Crash Bandicoot carries the--even then--overdone save the damsel in distress storyline, ala Mario saving Princess Peach over and over.  Much like Mario, however, Crash wasn't about storyline.  It was about gameplay, and here it's just as simplistic as it is in your average 2D side-scroller.  Crash only has two attacks.  His spinning attack and a jump attack.  You'll use this to take down your enemies.  There are advantages to using one attack over the other.  For example, the spinning attack can potentially send enemies flying into other enemies while the jump attack gives Crash some extra air, which is actually needed to access some of the games little secrets. Throughout each level, Crash also has the ability to obtain Aki-Aki.  A mask that serves to protect Crash.  If you have one you can sustain two hits before you die.  If you have two you can sustain three hits.  If you have three you'll be temporarily invincible.  The game also makes it a point to give you an Aki-Aki if you're dying too many times in a certain level, and believe me, that'll happen a lot.  The good news is that Crash Bandicoot isn't shy about giving you extra lives.  The bad news is that you'll still mow through a lot of them pretty quickly.  A lot of the times things are just unfair.  The camera is permanently fixed behind Crash, so sometimes it's hard to predict jumps, or sometimes even where some enemies are.  Also, the amount of surprises they throw at you can be annoying as well.  Like a bridge where the planks fall out and then you get to what is seemingly a dead end only to find out that you've no time to look because the plank your standing on is also lose.  Thus, you've no choice but to go through a lot of trial and error in levels. To its credit, though, Crash Bandicoot has a variety of levels.  There's the basic 3D platforming where you basically run through the level in a straight line with the camera behind you, but there are some levels that make you go about the old fashioned way by these levels being 2D side-scrollers.  There are also levels where you'll run from a boulder in Indiana Jones style, levels where you'll ride on a hog.  You'll get your fill from these levels.  Although, many level designs are also very simplistic and straightforward.  There's not a whole lot of exploration to be done, and even when you can veer off course, you'll only be backtracking to get back on the right course.  In short, many levels are just too linear. Mastering the game is also fairly difficult.  Throughout each level there are crates that you have to smash.  If you smash all the crates, you score a perfect.  Seems simple right?  Well, the catch is you have to smash every crate in the level without dying.  And again, with some unfair camera angles in some levels, and the trial and error, you'll be attempting to score a perfect on a level several times.  Likewise, it seems strange that the levels are so difficult yet the games bosses are so easily taken down--including the final boss Dr. Neo Cortex.  Most boss battles aren't a challenge, but getting to them sure as hell is. Even the games save system is flawed.  As you go through each and every level you'll find tokens that'll let you catch a glimpse of the girl Crash is out to save in this game.  The problem is this token is hidden in crates throughout the level.  The second problem is that you need three of them.  The THIRD problem is that you have to go through some stupid mini-level in order for your game to actually be saved.  They're played out in a 2D side-scroller like fashion with the exception that even in these levels there are some 3D elements, which again require trial and error to get through sometimes.  At least you don't lose a life... just the chance to save your game.  The FOURTH problem with this is that once you collect all three tokens, whether you were able to make it through the bonus round and save your game or not, you can't get them again.  Thus in each level you're only given the chance to save once, and you may not even get it!  This is inexcusable.  The later installments of the series certainly did a better job with the save feature.  There's also a password system here for those who don't have a memory card, and that's really nice to have.  Again, however, it sucks that you only really get one chance to save.  You can save after scoring a perfect on a level, but again, that's a one time deal.  You can't go to an easy level, score a perfect and save again. Despite its gameplay issues, Crash Bandicoot looked good at least.  Especially for a game released in 1996.  It runs fairly smoothly, and just looks great for the time of its release.  It wasn't a launch title, but at least it was a game that was easy on the eyes.  The levels also look good and even too this day the game still has a particular visual charm to it.  It can't hold a candle up to today's graphics but in 1996 this was a charmer.  The game also didn't sound so bad either.  Some tunes do get annoying, but a lot of tunes really satisfy the levels, and the sound effects are brilliant.  As far as presentation goes, Crash Bandicoot really knew how to hand it to us. Unfortunately, it's unforgiving difficulty may actually be enough to turn some fans away after a while.  Was it a good game?  Sure it was.  But the first installment just had a lot of unforgiving issues that thankfully were worked out in the second game.  It's not bad for a first outing, but a game shouldn't be so unforgiving in its difficulty. Pros: +It's a good looking game +It sounds good +Simple gameplay that anyone can pick up and learn +A variety of levels +Tons of secrets and little things to do; you'll be busy just trying to complete the game 100% Cons: -The difficulty level of this game is unforgiving -Bad camera angles -The games levels are difficult yet the games bosses are disturbingly easy -A lot of trial and error moments -Many levels are too linear -The save system set up is absolutely horrible It's still a good game, but later games in the series do a far better job.</td><td>Crash's First Outing is Flawed</td><td>1176681600</td><td>0</td><td>1269</td><td>5411</td><td>76</td><td>4.263987391646966</td><td>16.69736842105263</td><td>0.021779153</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>1974</td><td>1.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>07 26, 2006</td><td>B00000I1BQ</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Wasn't the very first Crash Bandicoot game supposed to become one of the all-time greatest Playstation games?  That's what Sony thought would happen back in the day.  After all, they promoted the game to death.  Well look at that... didn't happen!  And with good reason.  The game is horrible.  I can't believe ANYONE would prefer this junk over Sonic the Hedgehog or, especially, the Mario Bros. series. You have to give Sony a LOT of credit for all the attention they put into Crash Bandicoot in an attempt to put the game on the same extraordinary level as Mario and Sonic, but gamers never really caught on to Crash the same way.  When you think about it, the Playstation already HAD a huge selection of games to choose from around the time Crash was released, therefore Sony didn't even NEED a mascot.  People were buying Playstation games like crazy anyway!  Crash Bandicoot never even had to exist. You'd think for a debut game (a BIG debut, considering all the advertisements on TV commercials) Sony would have made the game a *little* easier for younger or inexperienced gamers to play.  Instead, Sony started off the Crash series with impossible bonus levels (impossible to complete AND find- I didn't even KNOW the game had bonus levels until I looked it up in the instruction booklet!) Even if you ignore the bonus levels, the challenge overall is pretty high anyway thanks to all the difficult stages (such as the one where you're crossing a bridge way up in the sky and continue falling through the wooden cracks- a NIGHTMARE of a level!)  All the lives you earned up to this point in the game will go away.  A mascot debut game shouldn't have the difficulty THIS high because the idea is for players of ALL ages to enjoy the game.  Children will not like the nonstop frustration. I think the biggest reason Crash Bandicoot isn't remembered today the same way Mario and Sonic's debut games are is because Crash is basically just a blend of Mario and Sonic, but featured in a 3D world.  Think about it.  Crash collects berries throughout the game (Mario collects coins, Sonic collects rings).  Crash has a spin attack (Mario and Sonic already had spin attacks YEARS before Crash's existence).  Sony just didn't have enough creative ideas to come up with something entirely different, and that's why most gamers tend to ignore Crash Bandicoot.  When you already have the best (Mario and Sonic) you don't need imitations. Crash Bandicoot may have improved later on (not enough of an improvement to earn its mascot reputation, however) but the series certainly did NOT start with a bang.  I will always remember the very first Crash Bandicoot game as being this uninteresting, frustrating experience.  Heck, just the fact that only 62 reviewers have submitted reviews for the game right here on amazon goes to show Crash Bandicoot's first adventure was meant to be gone and forgotten.  Add to the fact that right now in the year 2006 NO ONE is talking about ANY Crash Bandicoot game anymore.  This means you can ignore Crash Bandicoot entirely, and not really miss out on anything.</td><td>dull</td><td>1153872000</td><td>1</td><td>553</td><td>2537</td><td>28</td><td>4.587703435804702</td><td>19.75</td><td>-0.048843827</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>2031</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>02 14, 2008</td><td>B00000I1BS</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>Croc, original released in 1997 had the same appeal that Crash Bandicoot had.  It was a simplistic game that was absolutely gorgeous to look at.  Obviously inspired by Crash Bandicoot and Super Mario 64, Croc was a game that could've been for everyone.  However, lackluster controls and a bad camera make Croc more frustrating than fun. As with most games aimed at the younger audience, Croc has a simple story.  The Gobbos have been kidnapped by an evil Baron.  It's up to Croc to save the Gobbos and stop the Baron.  And he'll traverse four worlds to do it. The level layout of Croc is surprisingly good.  Levels are pretty straightforward but you'll be able to veer off path whenever you need to.  In every level your goal is to get to the end and ring the gong.  Along the way Croc will be faced with enemies and natural traps like lava or freezing waters.  In every level you'll also collect gems.  From level to level the total gems you finish with stack up on each other.  For every 100 gems you'll get an extra life, and you'll need those lives.  There are also six Gobbos in every level you venture to.  Five of them are scattered throughout the level randomly.  However, the last Gobbo requires you to find five special gems and open a special door at the end of a level.  Upon finding those gems and opening a special door, the game will usually make you play some kind of bonus game or solve a puzzle to get the last Gobbo.  Some of these parts of the game are incredibly frustrating.  For example, in one bonus game you'll have to make Croc jump on buttons in order to \"whack\" sheep in a sort of Whack the Mole fashion.  However, it speeds up and the controls aren't all that friendly. That may very well be the biggest problem with Croc.  The game is such a pain to control.  You'll suffer a lot for this.  Up always moves Croc forward but the camera is always moving.  Croc doesn't turn sharp enough so you'll mostly spend time stopping and turning so that you can continue on your way.  This wouldn't be so bad if there weren't enemies on your tail or if you didn't have to stop and turn on a collapsing platform.  Even worse is the camera.  You don't get control over it at all.  The view doesn't shift fast enough which may lead to you running into an enemy simply because you don't know where it is, or having to quickly jump off a collapsing platform.  These issues make Croc--an already challenging game as it is--harder than it has to be.  It's frustrating as well.  The game has potential, and the right gameplay elements, but the controls make it too hard.  However, it is still a good challenge.  Completing the game 100% by finding all the Gobbos and getting the second ending is a task in and of itself. What Croc lacks in gameplay it certainly makes up for in everything else.  The game looks stunning.  Especially for a Playstation game in 1997.  The FMVs look incredible, the bosses look spectacular.  The environments look incredible as well.  There are hardly any Playstation games that look this smooth or run this well.  The soundtrack is also a beautiful soundtrack.  In terms of production values, Croc is an astonishing game to behold. In short, Croc is a good game, but a game that would've been so much better if it didn't suffer from such horrible controls and a bad camera.  It's a fun game, but only barely so.  There will be many gamers who won't be able to let those issues slide.</td><td>A Good Game Ruined By Horrible Controls</td><td>1202947200</td><td>0</td><td>662</td><td>2761</td><td>48</td><td>4.170694864048339</td><td>13.791666666666666</td><td>0.029883659</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>2042</td><td>4.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>08 10, 2006</td><td>B00000I1BF</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Spyro the Dragon: the game that SHOULD have been Sony's mascot instead of Crash Bandicoot. The original Spyro the Dragon is probably the best platform/adventure game you can find for the Playstation.  I can't give Spyro's first adventure a 5-star rating, though.  Let's get the problems out of the way before moving on to the positive things about Spyro (and believe me, there's a LOT of good things about this game). People have compared Spyro the Dragon to everything from Crash Bandicoot to Banjo-Kazooie to Nights, and... who knows what else.  Well, I think the first Spyro game is JUST as good as all those games.  In fact, Spyro the Dragon is better than the first Crash Bandicoot game.  Now THERE'S a game that disappointed me.  Spyro came out of nowhere and RULED right from the beginning.  I never would have guessed back in 1998 that Spyro would have went on to become a classic. Spyro's debut does have a few problems, though.  Seeing as how this is Spyro's very first adventure I won't be TOO harsh.  Am I the only one who thinks the play control could have been better?  It's not that I have a tough time controlling Spyro.  Well, to be honest, I DID have trouble controlling him at first.  Spyro doesn't QUITE take off when you hit up, down, left or right on the directional pad.  There's a split second delay before moving forward.  Maybe the creators of the game thought this was part of the realism since, after all, you're moving a DRAGON.  A BIG creature like a dragon won't move forward right away.  Then again, Spyro is small compared to the dragons you have to rescue. Controlling Spyro was definitely a problem for me at first.  For example, attempting to properly jump on top of the three round platforms you encounter at the very beginning of the first world was NOT an easy task.  I kept sliding off.  By the way, I recommend you take advantage of these round platforms to get to know the controller.  Master the controller before exploring the world.  This will cut down on any possible frustration you may encounter in the future. I have to consider that my inability to control Spyro may have been due to the camera angles.  Even though the camera in this game is *drastically* better than many other games, you have to admit it isn't flawless either.  If you hit Pause and go to the options, you will see an option for a second camera view called \"active\".  This view is better because the camera immediately follows behind Spyro at ALL times.  The other (default) camera view is more of a hassle trying to figure out where you're moving, and you can't get a good view of what lies ahead.  You may want to change it to \"active\" if the other camera view is difficult for you.  Thank goodness for this option! Some people have a problem with the lack of challenge.  While it's completely true you won't have much trouble making it to the end of any stage in the game, prepare to die 4 or 5 times in each stage before you understand exactly what you have to do, and where you have to jump.  I think the most challenging thing about Spyro the Dragon are the times you have to jump onto a far-away platform, and many times you just BARELY make it.  Many times you will fall to your death.  Be patient, though.  The game NEVER messes with you by throwing in any impossible jumps.  Sometimes it's about finding *just* the right spot to jump and glide, and if you're off just a *little bit* you won't make it.  The creators of Spyro are smart not to make the game frustrating, seeing as how it's supposed to be a game for the entire family.  Good work. The biggest challenge comes at the very end of the game when you face the main boss.  He's really easy to beat, however, GETTING to him is a whole other story.  You see, right at the very end before you face him, you have to jump over a series of disappearing platforms and if you fall (and you WILL fall the first few times because it's hard) you will land in burning lava and have to do the whole stage over again.  Not that the stage is really that long anyway, but this is by FAR the hardest part of the game.  The other 99% of the game only offers a slight challenge here and there. With that said, don't be fooled into thinking the game will be a cakewalk because of all the easy obstacles found throughout World One.  It DOES get harder.  You see, many of the enemies you face in the later levels can only be defeated by either smacking them with your head, or shooting fire at them.  You won't know which of these tricks will be most effective on them until you face the enemy and experiment.  You also have to dodge fireballs, sword-swipes, dogs jumping at you, and tons of other enemy attacks WHILE you try to find the best way to defeat them.  So it's not pathetically easy after all. A minor complaint is that sometimes while you're walking or running, the path will suddenly end, and you'll fall to your death.  Doesn't happen often, but I thought it would be worth mentioning. I hate the way Spyro talks.  He sounds like a bratty teenage rebel with a nasally voice.  Not exactly what a dragons voice should sound like.  Also, when you rescue the dragons, sometimes they say important things you might want to pay attention to.  The problem here is that many times the important tips they say aren't really helpful because they say them right AFTER you've already had to do them!  For instance, in one case after you glide to a far-away platform and rescue a dragon, the dragon will tell you how to glide.  Obviously, since I needed to glide in order to rescue him, I already KNOW how to glide!  So I didn't NEED his help!  This happens a few times during the game.  You just want to scream \"Thanks for nothing, bonehead!\" The music was done by a member of the rock band the Police, Stewart Copeland.  People may not realize it, but certain themes in Spyro the Dragon are *very* close to some of the songs that made the Police such a legendary rock band.  Stewart Copeland may have intentionally created the music in this game to match that of the Police, specifically the songs \"walking on the moon\" and \"message in a bottle\".  You'll soon realize that the same guy who created the music in this game also played a big part in creating those Police songs.  The music in Spyro the Dragon is also very catchy and appropriate for the level you're in.  No complaints.  The music is fantastic. I think the creators made a mistake.  When you hit L2 the camera rotates clockwise, and R2 makes the camera rotate counter-clockwise.  It should be the other way around.  Another thing that needs reversed: the way Spyro flies in the bonus stages.  When you press up, you fly down.  When you press down, you fly up!  Strange mistake.  This makes it harder to complete the flying stages, however, you don't have to finish them. In fact, despite what people may tell you, you do *not* have to collect ALL the gems and ALL the dragons.  Finding and collecting all the gems and dragons will only give you a better percentage and open up a bonus stage at the end of the game.  The gameplay in Spyro the Dragon can actually be compared to Yoshi's Island- you don't have to find everything, but doing so will open up rewards and give you an overall better score.  The creators did a fantastic job hiding gems and dragons, increasing the challenge.  More often than not you will see a treasure chest or a dragon statue up high on a platform and not have a single clue how to reach it.  It's fun to run around and think about how to reach it.  Some of them are cleverly located.  One word to describe it- *awesome* Anyway, Spyro the Dragon is tons of fun and may possibly remind you of a 3D Donkey Kong Country, what with TNT barrels and the jungle levels you encounter later on.  Spyro is much better than that overrated Crash Bandicoot game, and you should pick up Spyro the Dragon today.</td><td>dragon madness!</td><td>1155168000</td><td>1</td><td>1507</td><td>6350</td><td>86</td><td>4.213669542136695</td><td>17.523255813953487</td><td>0.09170457</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>2090</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 7, 2005</td><td>B00000I1BJ</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Now THIS is how you're supposed to enjoy blowing through a bloody, violent game!  Blood squirting from moaning zombie bodies.  It's so strange and relaxing to experience this.  I know you will laugh at what I am about to tell you, but I never bothered with this game when it first came out.  Yeah, I know, I lost many friends because of this.  I ignored this game in 1998, and my level of coolness went right down the tubes.  I had to fail math and pretend to smoke cigars to fit back in with my classmates again. Children shouldn't play this game.  If you think it's ok for children to see the two main characters in this game shoot and fry their way through the police station then you might not be a reasonable person.  Yes that's right: you can walk through a police station in this game.  If in real life you have a problem with the way cops sit in a field and watch over you to make sure you have your seat belt on (and not one of those cases where you pretend to put the seat belt on until the cop is out of view and then take it off again) you now have a place to take out your frustrations- Resident Evil 2. The weapons in this game are realistically cool.  I like pulling out the magnum and shooting zombies in the head and watching their heads blow to pieces.  Don't try this at home, but do try this on your Playstation.  The magnum doesn't make much noise so you wouldn't think it'd be such a bad-ass weapon, but you can shoot at the head of a zombie and watch his head quietly blow to smithereens.  You know you shouldn't do that in real life though, right?  You'd go to jail for a very long time.  And if you tried to explain to the police that you were shooting at zombies, you'd only get laughed at by the entire court room.  Use your head. If this game doesn't satisfy your sick animal-like needs, then try looking for the fire blaster thing.  You can cook zombies with this.  It's near the end of the game hidden in a locker.  Go near the locker and press the X button, and it will open and you will say \"sweet\". In this game you have two CD's.  One CD is for the Leon adventure, and the other CD is for the Claire adventure.  You can choose to start the game with either Leon or Claire.  To do the game completely you have to beat the game twice with Leon and twice with Claire.  I've only ever played this game on easy and I had a blast.  I'm sure on normal it's quite harder, maybe so hard you can't think straight and become dumb.  Of course you aren't dumb, it's just that video games can confuse you sometimes. Man I'm tired.  But I'm never too tired to take a couple hours from my easy-going day and blasting my way through this super cool game.  The only downside is that you can't skip the cutscenes.  That's fine at first, when you want to listen closely to the story (even though I didn't) but after a while you really wish Capcom would have put a skip button on this thing. Still, great game.  It's old, but please don't be one of those people who thinks that just because something is old it's not good.  I've been around people who think like that and they just ain't cool.  Sure, these people get all the girls and all the friends, but what else?  What's \"in\" sucks, and what's old is cool.  You think I'm wrong?  Good for you.

Resident Evil 2 had everything the original had plus tons more; bigger more detailed environments, weirder puzzles, more suspense, more blood and gore, and a compelling story that kept the gamer on the edge of their seat.  In this installment you play as rookie cop Leon Kennedy or Claire Refield: the sister of Chris from the first game.  Instead of a secluded mansion like the first game, this time all of Raccoon City has been infected by Umbrella's virus and you have to wade through an assortment of flesh eating zombies, mutated dogs, hunters, a new monster called the Licker (whose introduction in the game is one of the most unforgettable parts in any video game), and some unbelieveably grotesque beasts who will stop at nothing until your dead.  Resident Evil 2 was an instant smash hit upon it's release and has since been regarded as a classic video game and an essential play for any gamer.  Since then, the game has been re-released on other systems such as the Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, and most recently the Gamecube; so now gamers of any generation can play one of the most addicting and innovative games of all time.</td><td>Capcom's incredible blockbuster follow up</td><td>1058659200</td><td>0</td><td>219</td><td>1020</td><td>7</td><td>4.657534246575342</td><td>31.285714285714285</td><td>0.030800866</td><td>805</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>2135</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>08 17, 2014</td><td>B00000ID61</td><td>Bryan</td><td>People used to make a big deal how Star Fox 64 was supposedly an improvement over the Super NES's Star Fox.  Not in my world it's not.  Star Fox 64 uses eye candy and colorful animations to disguise several moments of mediocrity.  No doubt it uses eye candy to disguise the lack of challenge.  The reason the Super NES's Star Fox was so successful is because it's able to combine challenge with really intense atmosphere giving the gamer the impression he's helpless in the galaxy (especially whenever your life is low- a feeling you hardly encounter in Star fox 64).  The pressure would get really intense whenever you begin to lose your teammates (Peppy, Slippy and Falco) and you wonder how much longer you'll be able to survive.  However I feel no pressure whatsoever in Star Fox 64 regardless how many of my animal friends go down or how low my health meter is. I think the game is going for a cinematic feel while completely ignoring a degree of challenge.  The game certainly *looks* good.  Another problem is that the enemy variety is really lackluster and you're hardly ever swarmed with too many enemies which is a negative in my book because it means the intensity of the flight shooting isn't quite strong or memorable enough overall.  The music is another major disappointment.  Whereas on the Super NES the music was extremely catchy, suspenseful and memorable, no such treatment occurs here in Star Fox 64.  Instead every stage has quiet generic hard rock with no noticeable melody and it sounds really average to me. While I don't mind having your team constantly radioing in and giving advice, it was a better format on the Super NES when they didn't actually speak.  This is because Peppy, Slippy and Falco talk a LOT.  Slippy in particular sounds like a child which is grating.  The enemy Andross talks a lot too.  Every few seconds you'll hear them speak and while some of the stuff they say is surprisingly enjoyable, I don't really want to hear it every time I fly a mission.  Most everything they say is playful anyway.  The explosion of enemy aircrafts tends to feel like an afterthought too, with no suspense occurring there either.  Tame explosions instead of violent and memorable ones like in the original Star Fox.  This is partly due to enemies appearing significantly less frequently than in the Super NES's Star Fox. Well let me mention the levels.  Meteo is decent but a boring imitation of the same type of dark space stage we see in the Super NES's Star Fox where you're constantly surrounded by flying boulders and a high danger level.  In fact that's the biggest problem with this game- you swerve around traps and enemies *some* times, but it's never a very threatening or frequent occurrence.  It's a very tame flight you're taking most of the time.  Fortuna is a generic level with lots of flying and very little action.  Sector X is a high point due to featuring several moments of swarming around dangerous traps and closing objects while Titania is a pretty decent level while driving around on the ground in the landmaster vehicle. Boise Defense Outpost contains a force field, and it gets tedious chasing enemies for a while.  Katina is tedious as well since it takes forever to open hatches on enemies.  It's boring.  Solar is awesome however since it involves dodging giant snake-shaped fireballs.  Macbeth is a train chase on the landmaster.  It's a pretty fun stage but the boss fight is once again tedious since it takes forever to defeat.  Sector Y is an awesome outer space dark level avoiding floating space crafts.  Aquas Ocean is even MORE awesome!  Hey alright, some memorable levels for a change.  The statues you fly past are quite intimidating and the sight to see in this stage.  The eye candy graphics from the explosions are unique too. Toxic Waste Area is a unique toxic ocean level with a tough as nails boss fight made of armor.  The snakes coming out of the toxic water is cool too.  Sector Z is generic and forgettable since it lacks combat.  Area 6 contains a memorable disappearing disc-shaped tentacle boss with a giant golden-colored planet in the background.  I admire this stage's appearance.  Venom: Andross Homeworld begins on a lackluster note featuring generic enemy chasing and shooting, but immediately after this part is over the level turns WAY more intense and atmospheric (claustrophobic in particular).  The Andross boss itself is memorable mainly for the intimidating appearance of his first form and less about the second form which involves shooting aimlessly and hoping you hit your target. Boss fights feel significantly less suspenseful perhaps due to them being easy with predictable weak points for one thing, and also the lack of suspenseful music.  This is why the Super NES version is so much better.  Don't get me wrong guys, I *do* admire this game, but I almost never feel like playing it knowing a better version of Star Fox is out there.</td><td>decent space shooter</td><td>1408233600</td><td>0</td><td>888</td><td>4048</td><td>49</td><td>4.558558558558558</td><td>18.122448979591837</td><td>0.073933266</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A3W4D8XOGLWUN5</td><td>2157</td><td>4.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>10 20, 2002</td><td>B00000ID61</td><td>Michael Kerner</td><td>In 1997, Nintendo was on the cutting edge in the video gaming industry. The Nintendo 64 proved that no mateer what a CD-ROM gaming system was able to do, a cartridged based gaming system could do better. That June, the case really proved the theory with the release of Starfox 64. The game was the very first to incorporate Nintendo's Rumple Pak, a force-feedback device that let's players feel each and every vibration at hand. In the game, you play Fox McCloud, a young determined fighter pilot who is sent on several missions to destroy Andross, a inane, mad genius that demands full control of the Lylat system. There are 15 remarkable stages that let you encounter in the entire game, alone over twenty-five different paths you decide on your way to Andross. The graphics are so realistic and full of promise, that you see the game so vividly, you feel like you're a part of it. In Starfox 64, you also have the use of 3 different vehicles, depending on your course, Arwing, Landmaster Tank, or the Blue Marine sub, only used in the Aquas sea level. The game also has a fierce battle level, for up to 4 players, where you shoot down your fellow squadron leaders, Peppy, Falco, and Slippy. It took nearly two years for other companies to develop the feel of the game, the exact same way Nintendo did with Starfox 64. The game is exactly one of a kind in the pilot seat. While Nintendo stopped releasing the Rumble Pak with the game nearly six months later, Starfox 64 is still truly a Nintendo gamer's paradise.</td><td>Good Vibrations</td><td>1035072000</td><td>1</td><td>272</td><td>1242</td><td>13</td><td>4.5661764705882355</td><td>20.923076923076923</td><td>-0.0066358023</td><td>536</td></tr><tr><td>A3W4D8XOGLWUN5</td><td>2168</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>03 28, 2003</td><td>B00000ID60</td><td>Michael Kerner</td><td>Although there are video games out there that can wow you, and then there are the duds. Not all racing games seem to be the best behind the wheel. In the case of a video game coming based from an arcade version, it really seems to be alright, but looks are always decieving. In the case of Nintendo 64, there are very few racing games that really can make it behind the wheel. This isn't really one of them. The 1996 Crus'n U.S.A. game for Nintendo 64, seems to be a real miss behind the real wheel. The graphics are very strong, but you are limited down to a certain number of cars to choose from, which is seven, not like the more than dozen that there are in the arcade game. Although the courses seem to be within detail, there are so many flaws, including th frame rate and the style of the game, especially within the tunnels of place like Washington D.C. Nevertheless, the game seem to be a little down and out, but at the time it came out for Nintendo 64, it was one of only two video racing games for the Nintendo 64. It is kind of dissapointing that they couldn't try to make some better video games with racing at the time, but there are so many better choices to the Nintendo 64.

You usually have to kill a certain amount of scientists, administer vaccines to victims, disarm bombs, turn off power grids. The objectives vary, but what is fun is figuring out how to get there. Syphon Filter has some of the most memorable levels I can remember. This is a game you play several times and remember where every enemy is, every crate location, and even how to kill each enemy. The levels vary with stealth sections, climbing, and timed areas. The game features a smart lock-on system because there is no camera control. It is surprisingly smart and follows you wherever you go. Enemies wearing flak jackets can only be taken out with head shots or very powerful weapons. This requires aiming in first person mode and taking them out. This flak jacket element is a staple of the series and will go on to be in every game. It is actually an element all on its own and not just body armor for you or the enemy. You can die very easily and if you don't stop and aim for head shots you will waste ammo and/or die very quickly. There are a couple of boss fights thrown in such as a helicopter midway and Rhoemer himself at the end. I found all gameplay elements to be evenly tossed up so you are never bored. The stealth elements need a bit of work and are probably the worst thing about the game, but it is very minor. Crouching and sneaking around works fine, but enemies tend to see you at unknown distances. Maybe a line of sight cone on the radar would help this. You also have to get in head shots otherwise they won't die right away and alert other guards. Weapon selection is also a bit flimsy because you have to hold down select and use L2 and R2 (strafe buttons) to select the weapon. I would have preferred a radial menu instead. Some levels can be a bit hard to navigate are too dark to see. Thankfully you get a flashlight you can equip because some levels are nearly pitch black. I found myself lost a few times because even though the level design is fantastic, some levels can look the same with confusing hallways and misplaced crates and boxes. I actually learned about weapons as a kid from this game. Real world weapons are in here and some that I have never seen in any other game before. The weapons are almost a character all on their own because they feel so good to shoot in the game. The K3G4 will cut through flak jackets easily and is probably the only weapon that will do this. The G18 is a super fast sub-machine pistol, while the silenced 9mm is a staple of the series. The shotgun, combat shotgun, PK-102, BIZ-2, Nightvision Rifle, .45, HK5, and a few more are all excellent weapons. It was also the distinct sounds the developers used that make these guns so memorable. The game has a great sniper scope that was unseen in games back then. There are grenades and gas grenades which are great for taking out a group of enemies stealthily. There are a lot of great weapons in the game and they are very memorable unlike most shooters. While the game itself is amazing the graphics were pretty good at the time. Looking pretty realistic art wise, the game had some good lighting effects and a lot of detail everywhere. I also have many fond memories of this game as a kid. I actually accidentally rented Silent Hill because I forgot the name of this game. I got all the way to the Pharcom Warehouse levels and had to turn the game in. I rented this game many times over and played it to death as a kid. I purchased it a few times here and there and every time I play this it brings back fond memories.

That's what I think.  Syphon Filter is atrocious.  I received this game as a Christmas present (gee, what a crappy gift) back in the late 90's.  I thought to myself \"well, all the N64 players have Goldeneye, I can compete with them when I receive Syphon Filter for my Playstation!\"  How wrong I was. It's not that the actual game is bad.  I mean, walking around shooting people is fun, and it's also fun to avoid being seen and make it to the end of the level without having to fire your weapon once (and having to remain VERY quiet while doing so).  The problem is that the difficulty is incredibly high and the storyline is about as interesting as watching the paint your baby brother smeared all over your television set dry. Without a certain special code it's REALLY hard to get *anywhere*.  The storyline is similar to one you'd see in the TV show Jag.  It's just not interesting to me.  Walking around shooting people is fun, but that's all the game has going for it.  Now imagine if that special code didn't exist where you can kill people in just one or two shots.  The difficulty would be out of this world. I also hate the game for the bad memories connected to it.  The Christmas I got the game, I had a few bad personal things happen.  But looking back, Syphon Filter really isn't any good. It's not surprising to me that the game is going for only a couple pennies right now used, and only a couple dollars to buy brand new.  It's not even worth THAT much!</td><td>just avoid it</td><td>1152403200</td><td>0</td><td>298</td><td>1226</td><td>19</td><td>4.114093959731544</td><td>15.68421052631579</td><td>-0.07951981</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>2446</td><td>5.0</td><td>119</td><td>false</td><td>10 31, 2000</td><td>B00000INR2</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The expansion pack beefs up the graphics capability of the standard Nintendo 64 Unit. This in itself should make any gamer run out and grab one - when you compare the price of this to the price of one of the new consoles, you're saving tons of money! What does it do? For some games that work both with and without the expansion pack, it greatly increases the types of graphics shown during gameplay. Pod Racer is a stellar example. Play without the pack, and you get rings and blocky graphics. Add in the pack and you suddenly have lens flare, details of ships racing beside you, crucial information about upcoming turns. It makes the game play the way the developers intended. It's like watching The Matrix on a shoddy VHS tape copied from a friend, and then seeing it on DVD. It's an amazing difference for a very low price. In addition, many new games coming out are so graphic-intensive that they require the expansion pack to even play. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is a key example. This is an EXCELLENT game with great extended gameplay, but you can't even start if you don't have this pack in place. It's not difficult to install - you simply plug it in once and it stays there permanently. You can still play older games with it in place.

I was twelve years old, in middle school, and the Pokemon games debuted in the United States for the very first time.  A game so simple and yet at the very same time: So complex.  Nothing was more addictive, nothing was more fun than playing Pokemon.  If you remember the craze (the REAL craze, presently it isn't nearly as strong as it was back then), then you remember what it was like to go to school back in those days.  Suddenly EVERYONE had a Gameboy.  Suddenly even those who didn't normally play games or even know what the hell a Gameboy was, had it.  And you'd go up to your friends and you'd trade Pokemon, you'd taunt each other about who was the better champion when you battled.  You got in arguments over who the best starter was.  Then you learned of those glitches to get all your Pokemon to level 100 by duplicating the Rare Candies.  You caught Missingno and M-Block and caught Safari Zone Pokemon by exploiting what may very well be one of the most widely known glitches in video game history.  And of course, you went to catch them all, and you probably had that ONE friend who you deemed your rival and you had to catch 'em all before he did.  If you remember all this, you're a true Pokemon fan.  This isn't a myth, this game debuted, sold gazillions of copies and started a craze that--while it isn't as strong--still exists today.  This was one of the heights of gaming period. The Red and Blue versions may have seen stateside release in 1998, but the game was actually made in 1995.  Before the television show came around.  When the TV series took off in America, the games came next and as I said, they sold more copies than the latest installment of Harry Potter.  I'm not kidding. Red and Blue began almost everything you currently see in the series today.  The game begins with you naming your character (you couldn't choose between a boy or a girl in this one) and then your rival.  Again, if you had Pokemon fever you probably named your main character Ash and your rival was named Gary (even the strategy guides referred to them as such).  It began with Professor Oak letting you have a Pokemon of your choice (between 3 starters) and then ultimately he'd send you on a journey with a Pokedex and have you document the Pokemon you'd find.  Along the way, you'd have to deal with Team Rocket, the bad guys who are always causing trouble and stealing everyone's Pokemon, as well as gather eight badges so you could challenge the Elite Four and become a Pokemon League Champion.  The entire formula began here, and just about everything mentioned above has been done in each and every main series Pokemon game hereafter. What was perhaps the strangest thing about Pokemon is that the game was surprisingly deep in terms of combat.  It was your traditional turn-based combat.  Simple, yet it was so complex.  For one, the game has a Rock/Paper/Scissors method to it.  Every Pokemon has a type, and every type has its own strengths and weaknesses.  For example, Water is strong up against fire but it is weak vs. Grass.  Grass is weak vs. fire etc. etc.  No Pokemon is invincible.  They all have a weakness to some type.  Though in these versions the psychics definitely have an unfair advantage as the type they're weak against (bug) is almost non-existent and there are hardly any bug type attacks. In the battle menu you're given a list of commands.  Fight, Item, PKMN, or Run.  You can switch Pokemon you've caught in and out of battle on the fly, but it'll usually cost you a turn.  It's the strategic portion of Pokemon that makes battling fun and addictive.  As you go through the game you'll be challenged by trainers and you never know what they'll throw at you!  It's completely unpredictable and some of them are tough.  It's also interesting because with 150 different Pokemon, the amount of teams you can make are endless, and it really makes you think about what types you want in your roster.  Because most of the Pokemon types are weak vs. more than just one type.  It's also important that you give them a variety of moves, as the moves are also typed.  On paper it doesn't seem like much, but when you actually play the game, you'll find a clog in your drain you didn't even know you had because you thought your team was perfect... but then that one Pokemon comes along and exposes your fatal flaw. Pokemon was no short game.  It was full of all sorts of side quests.  From the Safari Zone, to catching the Legendary Birds, to the Unknown Dungeon.  There was plenty to do, and even after the game was over there was STILL more to accomplish.  Of course, your main accomplishment was getting them all.  Pokemon could easily keep you busy for well over 60 hours.  In 1998 this is an amazing feat seeing as how most RPGs of TODAY don't keep you busy that long.  The main quest itself only took a measly 15 hours or so, but all the extra content kept you on your toes. Even more, Pokemon was one of the few Gameboy Games that made excellent use of the link cable.  Since Red and Blue versions had different Pokemon, some only appeared in certain versions.  You couldn't for example, catch a Magmar in the Red version, but you could in Blue.  How then, were Red players supposed to catch all 150?  By trading.  Until Pokemon came around, my link cable was collecting dust.  Trading was usually a slow grueling process, though.  Traded Pokemon also got an experience boost so they were easier to train. Even more exciting than trading, however, was what really made Pokemon a blast to play: Battling.  You and your friends could get together and battle one another!  Test out your Pokemon teams against your friends.  They were, more often not, far better to battle against than the games trainers.  It's always interesting to see who your opponents heavy hitter is.  With your friends it was always interesting.  Imagine how embarrassed you were to say a certain Pokemon sucked only to discover that the trainer actually did a good job training? As far as the game looks and sounds, it didn't really look all that great when it was released in 1998 (it was after all, a game made in 1995).  On the original gameboy it was pretty grainy (but very clear on the Gameboy Pocket) and of course it was black or white (unless you played it on a Super Gameboy or Gameboy Color).  For a Gameboy game, though, it actually wasn't too bad.  It was annoying to watch a Pokemon simply flinch to attack, and some of the animations weren't all that great, but it was to be expected due to the Gameboy's limitations.  The music, however, was fantastic.  The tunes were catchy--particularly the trainer battles and gym leader battles.  The only really annoying thing was the sound effects.  They weren't all that great, and its a shame that Nintendo actually continues to use those exact same sound effects in Pokemon games today.  Still, for what it's worth, this was the game you wanted on the Gameboy. Pokemon is a classic.  It'll always be a classic.  No matter who you are, if you played Pokemon ten years ago, the craze was completely undeniable.  If you got addicted like I did, chances are you're still playing today.  Because in its core, the game was far deeper than you thought it was, and the series continues to use that same basic formula even today.</td><td>This is Where It All Began</td><td>1177977600</td><td>1</td><td>1377</td><td>5932</td><td>86</td><td>4.307915758896151</td><td>16.011627906976745</td><td>0.0730875</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>2647</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>11 27, 2010</td><td>B00000J2W7</td><td>Ryan Sil.

While the Sega CD system didn't last very long, Lunar did manage to get quite a following.  Unfortunately, because the Sega CD user base wasn't large, Lunar was overlooked by several gamers.  The game had a release on the very short lived Sega Saturn, but again, never reached audiences.  In 1999 Lunar finally reached a large audience.  The Playstation.  With several changes and updates from the original Sega CD version to make the story more complete and satisfying. Lunar Silver Star Story Complete concerns itself with Alex.  He one day dreams of being a Dragonmaster.  Just like his hero, Dyne.  He figures he'll just have to keep dreaming, though.  Until his friend Ramus has a plan to go into the White Dragon cave and get a hold of the White Dragon Diamond.  Finally, a chance for Alex to go on an adventure.  But it ends up becoming much bigger than he ever dreamed. For the most part, Lunar Silver Star Story has a cliched overly done storyline.  Despite that, however, it is one of the best in the genre because it has a fantastic cast of characters who are all well developed, a good sense of humor, one of the best villains in video game history as well as a very emotional story.  All these things make you forget the cliched storyline and make it something enjoyable and memorable.  The story also has a few really great looking anime cinematics and some incredibly good voice acting to help flesh out the humor and wit.  It also helps that the dialog is extremely well written.  Put simply, the story is presented very well. The gameplay is dated, but that's to be expected for a game originally released in 1992.  Lunar has a straightforward combat system.  It's the simple turn based fare you've seen in dozens of RPGs.  You'll select an action for every character to do and then watch the battle play out as your enemies and you take turns.  Every character can either attack, use special techniques unique to only them use items and run away, etc.  Battles are contact based.  That doesn't mean enemies will simply let you waltz by.  Many enemies upon seeing you will give chase. Lunar is by no means a complicated game.  Every character gains magic through levels (save for Alex who will get a few spells from meeting certain objectives in the story) and has their own unique magic.  For example, Nash is the only character who can cast Thunder Magic.  There are a few tidbits to the battle system that help flesh it out and keep it from being overly repetitive.  For one, characters who use staves can use them to cast spells that they otherwise might not be able to cast.  There's also a huge emphasis on strategy here.  Lunar is not an easy game by any stretch of the imagination.  Especially up against the bosses.  You'll find you have to move your characters all over the field and heal every turn to keep yourself a float.  To make matters even more difficult, you only have a limited number of items you can carry and on top of that, items at the market are quite expensive and monsters don't drop a lot of money.  So even though battles are contact based, it's probably best to fight as many as you can.  The only major problem with Lunar's battle system is that battles aren't quick.  Even normal battles can last for several minutes because of having to heal yourself constantly.  For the most part, though, the trip through the game is very rewarding. Visually, Lunar is a very colorful, artistic looking, smooth running game.  It doesn't push the Playstation to its limits, but it does manage to be a good game nonetheless.  The artistic design is incredibly well done, though.  So are the character portraits and animated cutscenes.  It's actually a very beautiful looking game, but it looks like a smooth over sixteen bit game too.  Luckily, this won't bother most gamers. It sounds pretty good.  As mentioned before, the voice acting is some of the best in the industry.  Many of the tunes are quite catchy (particularly the world map and battle themes).  They're short tracks, though, so they loop real soon, which makes much of the music quite repetitive.  In the long run, though, you're getting quite a bit. Lunar Silver Star Story Complete originally came with a lot of extras.  A soundtrack CD filled with the best tracks, a cloth map, a making of CD and a hardcover instruction booklet that even included a sample of the strategy guide made by Working Designs themselves.  It's quite the collector's item to have. Lunar Silver Star Story Complete is a fantastic RPG that despite being released on the Playstation, was still fairly overlooked.  It does, however, retain a strong audience.  A fine game where the effort of the creators really shows through fantastic writing, a well crafted story and some of the most well developed characters to grace the genre.</td><td>One of the Best RPGs Ever Made</td><td>1199232000</td><td>1</td><td>898</td><td>3963</td><td>60</td><td>4.413140311804009</td><td>14.966666666666667</td><td>0.1874953</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>2951</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>06 3, 2013</td><td>B00000JHPT</td><td>Bryan</td><td>I feel so hypnotically enchanted floating through endless rings as Superman with the distant soaring effects peacefully sounding in the background.

Boasting a colossal story and a few memorable characters.  Final Fantasy VII is the game which made the JRPG genre big in the West and eleven years later it still ranks as one of the greatest games of all time. Final Fantasy VII centers on Cloud Strife.  A mercenary who has joined the rebelious group known as AVALANCHE, who are taking on the Shinra Corporation, that is slowly draining the planet of its life.  The story all comes together by Cloud's mysterious past, a terrifying villain and some heartfelt characters.  The story of Final Fantasy VII spans so much more than just an evil Corporation.  You'll eventually find yourself on a journey that involves you saving the world.  Even compared to today, Final Fantasy VII is an RPG that breaks the rules of traditional storytelling.  Rather than being a band of teenagers out to stop some evil adults (as the JRPG has been drowned out in in recent years), Final Fantasy VII puts you in the role of characters about something more.  If there were any criticism of the story, it would be that it's a lot to take in.  Some things never really come together in the end and you'll be left with a lot of burning questions.  Much of this, you can bet, is due to some of Final Fantasy VII's shoddy translation.  There were some pieces in the localization process that were left out entirely and make the story come off as a little more sloppy than it was intended to.  Another small criticism comes with its characters.  While they're memorable, they often times take a backseat to some of the stories progression.  Once we learn what we need to learn about certain characters, the game never really touches them or makes them integral to the plot itself again.  If it weren't for their stark personalities, funny quips and own charms, you might forget them. Ever since Final Fantasy IV, the series has used the ATB battle system and Final Fantasy VII is no exception.  Every character has an ATB gauge that lets them take action once it's filled.  Pretty basic, but Final Fantasy VII gets a bump by being very customizable.  The Materia system allows for nearly endless possibilities for its characters.  There are several different kinds of Materia.  There's your basic magic materia that give you spells to cast, but there is also materia to give you more battle commands such as being able to steal or throw items at an enemy.  There are other materia there just to boost your stats and others that enhance your spells by giving you the ability to hit all the enemies at once or to absorb health from your enemies.  There are far more in each category and they give you infinite ways to play Final Fantasy VII. Without materia, though, your characters are naked and can only attack.  This brings about small problem.  The first being that there's is no incentive to use any one character above another.  Final Fantasy VII remedies this by givng its character ultra powerful limit breaks.  Every character has a limit gauge and when it fills up as they take damage.  When full they can let forth a brutal attack.  Characters also have limit levels for different limit breaks and the higher the Limit Level the more damage you have to take before its full.  Unfortunately, this is all that makes any character different in battle.  Materia gives them legs, but you can always transfer over anyone else's materia to anyone else.  In the long run this won't bother anyone, but it leads to a lack of variety in the characters and you more than likely won't need limit breaks that much to begin with.  Final Fantasy VII's pros more than outnumber the cons.  The amount of customization is great, but it still would've been nice to need one character's ability over another. Final Fantasy VII is by no means a hard game.  It is arguably one of the easiest games in the series.  In particular, the final battle turns out to be one of the easiest fights in the game against someone who has often been labeled one of the most threatening in history.  Yet Final Fantasy VII makes for that with several hidden goodies.  You won't find too many optional dungeons in Final Fantasy VII, but you will find an incredible number of optional things to do off the beaten path.  From breeding and racing Chocobos, to finding hidden materia, to taking on ultra powerful bosses and even finding hidden characters who have more than just a face, but actually play into the story itself.  There are more secrets in Final Fantasy VII than even most RPGs of today. Graphically Final Fantasy VII is a mixed bag.  In 1997 these graphics were phenominal.  the pre-rendered backgrounds are still incredible looking even to this day.  The seventh Final Fantasy has a lot of style.  The polygons are charming though they don't look as cool as the rest of the environments.  The FMVs are still amazing and wonderfully detailed for its time.  There are a couple of moments of slowdown with Final Fantasy VII, however, and some of the summon animations can get lengthy and repetitive.  But they don't take away from its wildly detaile environments. The music score may actually be the most rewarding thing for Final Fantasy VII.  The music score manages to fill the situations for the right moment.  But it also isn't afraid to showcase a lot of emotion either.  There are some moments where it can be dark and others where it's very light.  In particular, the character themes are really nice and memorable.  Final Fantasy VII doesn't have the best soundtrack within the series, but it has some of the most memorable music numbers of the entire series. After eleven years Final Fantasy VII is still a force to be reckoned with.  There are a few gaps in its storyline that you may have to read a bit more deeply to learn about (as not all of it is within the game itself, but if anything confuses you there have been countless FAQs written as well as spin-offs and sequels) and it shuns some of its characters at points, but the package is still one of the best Playstation outings of all time, and every gamer should pick up and play Final Fantasy VII at least once.</td><td>One of the Finest RPG Outings</td><td>1221350400</td><td>0</td><td>1214</td><td>5422</td><td>62</td><td>4.466227347611203</td><td>19.580645161290324</td><td>0.10757413</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>3262</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>03 18, 2007</td><td>B00000JRSB</td><td>Bryan</td><td>People seem to forget the number one reason Final Fantasy 7 is loved so fondly and remembered all these years later- it was one of the first video games able to tell a story that MILLIONS of people cared about.

It was also groundbreaking back in the day having extremely-realistic cutscenes featured, along with a quest that carried over 3 discs.  That's why the game is remembered.

You play as Cloud, a member of a team of environmental bandits. This rebel group is trying to stop Shinra, an evil corporation, from stealing all of the planet's energy, \"Mako\". The leap in graphics between Final Fantasy VI and this one is pretty amazing. Where FF6 was a 2D game with 16 bit graphics, this one was fully rendered 3D graphics. You move your polygonal character through a richly painted \"mural\" of a world. The sound quality is also much better. Along the way, Cloud is joined by Barret, who looks and talks like Mr. T from the A Team. Tifa Lockheart and Aeris Gainsborough also join him - both are characters that are found on the FF/Disney blend Kingdom Hearts. Of course there is a Wedge and Biggs, named after the Star Wars characters. In fact, one of Biggs' early lines is almost straight from the movie. There's a Cid too - he's an airship pilot. This is the Cid they used in Kingdom Hearts. Finally you reach and meet Sepiroth, and his many forms. The game is very rewarding to play, even though its graphics have been surpassed by later versions of Final Fantasy.</td><td>Still great after all these years</td><td>1050710400</td><td>1</td><td>221</td><td>1011</td><td>17</td><td>4.574660633484163</td><td>13.0</td><td>0.14806817</td><td>862</td></tr><tr><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>3367</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>04 9, 2002</td><td>B00000JRSB</td><td>N.

GamePro had allready said it may be the greatest game ever made, and that itself is quite a title.  I never really liked RPG's, I'm more of an action gamer, but with all the hype surrounding this game, I figured what the [heck] and rented it a few days after it came out.  I was dumbfounded the first time I played it, I was speachless.  At the time I had never seen graphics like that, and the storyline was so engrossing that I felt a wave of depression actually set over me when I had to take it back.  As pathetic as that sounds, the day I returned it to the video store, I went out and bought Final Fantasy VII and kept playing for days.  Eventually I beat it, then a buddy of mine showed me his strategy guide and I realized I missed a lot of side stuff and extras, so I played through again using the guide, and the experience was even better.  If you have never played any Final Fantasy game before this one is worth picking up, even if you don't like RPG's you'll dig this, though I suggest picking up the BradyGames strategy guide to make the game even sweeter.

Either to destroy it or attain it for their own means.  When Namco began talking about a sequel one of the first things they knew they wanted to incorporate was the use of the entire arena instead of just characters moving on one line.  This eventually lead the creation of 8 way run.  Where one could--literally--walk circles around their opponent.  But was it right to simply call it Soul Blade 2?  Project Soul thought not.  Instead they called their new creative and innovative fighter: Soul Calibur. Though not having a fantastic run in Arcades, the game was ported to the Dreamcast in 1999 and launched with the system.  When it was released it was such a smashing success and offered so much for players that we had a new champion of fighters.  It was simple enough for newcomers but had enough depth for experts.  But more than that, 8 way run and the detail the game had was, at the time, just unheard of.  Looking at it now, it's hard to believe the game was originally made in 1998.  It was not only well ahead of its time, but the only game that really seemed to give it any competition was the release of Soul Calibur II years later.  Since it's release the original Soul Calibur has gone on to be recognized as one of the greatest and most innovative games ever made.  And to this day, the only game that is really like Soul Calibur are the other Soul Calibur games. Many fighting games are not much for their stories.  A lot of them can tell a story but they're primarily about the fighting.  The original Soul Calibur is the same way, but there is actually an emphasis on characters and the relationships that these characters feel they have with other characters.  Every character has their own unique ending to Arcade Mode and every character has a biography that you can read to learn about them.  There's definitely a story and a narrative at work here.  As you read about the characters you'll learn as to why each of them are going after Soul Edge.  Their stories are tragic but interesting.  It's even more fun for those who played the original Soul Blade.  Things hadn't become quite convoluted with the story yet.  And when you read about all these characters some of them you're bound to find intriguing in their own way.  You may even find yourself having a favorite.  Not just because of how they fight... but because of who they are as a person.  They've got personality here and it shows not only in their exchanges in combat, their endings in Arcade and their biographies, but also in just how well they fight. Soul Calibur has a simple way of fighting.  You've got horizontal, vertical and kick attacks.  You can also guard and, of course, move all around the ring.  You can also combine attacks by pressing two buttons simultaneously for different attacks.  The implimentation of 8 way run really increases the number of moves which can be done.  It's simple to pick up Soul Calibur but the game itself is fairly difficult to master.  Unlike other games, there is actually qutie an emphasis on pokes, precise strikes and quick moves rather than emphasising the need to learn tons of special moves and combos.  It certainly doesn't hurt to learn these things, but no one will feel powerless when playing Soul Calibur.  But it does have a few complex moves and combos none the less.  Some characters have slide input movements while others may have attacks that require much more precise timing.  Anyone can pick up the game and utilize pokes, but a true master will actually have to sit down and train with some of their favorite characters. It's also to no surprise that Soul Calibur does put a huge emphasis on the player's ability to move all over the arena instead of just in a straight line where they my have moves that step to the side.  This is emphasized by the fact that any character can also attack while circling another.  Or they can use this to side step opponents.  This wasn't just some gimmick thrown in, this was pretty much what Soul Calibur was all about.  To put more emphasis on this, Soul Calibur allows players to knock one another out of the ring.  If there was anything that stood out in Soul Calibur as a real flaw it MIGHT be this little tidbit.  Unlike future games in the series, the first game made knocking someone out of the ring a fairly simple thing to do.  Characters went out of the ring far more easily than otherwise.  And while it's great to snatch a victory through ring out, it can be a pain when you suffered a ring out just because a very small portion went over the ring. Aside from that, Soul Calibur was a nearly flawless game.  It managed to do this by offering players what the Arcade couldn't.  Before Soul Calibur came out in 1999 if you wanted the best graphics and best experience with fighting games you typically went to Arcade to have it.  Soul Calibur was one of the games that helped to change this, in part because of the Dreamcast.  The Dreamcast version of the game looked and sounded better than the Arcade version.  The stages were more detailed.  The backgrounds, rather than being pre-rendered, were actually in 3D.  The game was the prettiest thing on the market in 1999.  And the characters were also detailed.  The console version of the game also offered different modes.  You had the typical Arcade mode, but the game also gave you a survival mode and things to keep you busy such as the game's Mission Mode.  Where you went to various stages to partake in missions.  These missions earned you points, which you could exchange in the Art Gallery.  Sometimes when you bought art in the gallery you unlocked other missions, stages or character exhibition theaters.  There was a lot to unlock in Soul Calibur.  It was an experience you simply couldn't have in the Arcade. As a result, Soul Calibur has also managed to age well, in part because it was so far ahead of its time.  In fact, its sequels can only seem to do worse because aside from tweaking characters and adding moves, there isn't really much you can do to improve the experience of Soul Calibur.  A franchise that achieves this much critical and commercial success right out of the gate doesn't really have anywhere to go but down.  And indeed, the Soul Calibur series has often been criticized that not much has been done to the basic formula as the years have gone by.  But when you play the first game it becomes apparent that it's really hard to build on that particular foundation.  We're talking about a game that was hailed by critics and consumers as one of the greatest games of all time when it first dropped onto the Dreamcast in 1999 (and is one of the few games on Amazon that still retains a five star rating years later).  Where exactly do you go from \"Greatest,\" exactly?  No where, really.  But it seems to be a testament as to how powerful and impactful Soul Calibur really ended up being.  The original still manages to be a strong game even by todays standards. The Soul continues to burn bright and those who still have their Dreamcast should own this game.  It is not just one of the best games you can find on the system, but still remains as one of the greatest games ever made.</td><td>\"Welcome Back to the Stage of History...\"</td><td>1335312000</td><td>1</td><td>1393</td><td>5997</td><td>79</td><td>4.305096913137114</td><td>17.632911392405063</td><td>0.12484069</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>3442</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>12 19, 2004</td><td>B00000K125</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Soul Calibur is the classic version of the arcade game, and is only available on the Dreamcast. For many, it's the main reason to buy a Dreamcast! You get a nice selection of characters, both male and female, young and old. If there's a complaint about the characters, it's that the females tend to have VERY skimpy outfits that mostly show off jiggly breasts and lots of underwear. The guys tend to have fully covered bodies. Something's not quite even here. There are a number of modes, between simple arcade mode, one on one combat, training demos, and more. As you play through the game you earn points, which let you unlock more secrets. It encourages you to go through the game as each character, learning their best moves and techniques. Each character has his or her own favorite weapons and combat style. As with all fighting games, you have to get used to the violence. The characters are bashing each other with some rather nasty moves - and it doesn't necessarily stop when one person is defeated. I've seen my character kicked to the ground, the game announce my defeat, and then the enemy throw in a final, gratuitous kick. It's very discouraging. The different levels are fun, with their atmosphere and backgrounds. The music is on the generic side and doesn't go themed with the world you're in, as more modern fighters tend to do. Also it is sometimes fairly easy to simply knock your opponent out of the ring and be done with it. Also, on the sounds angle, there are only a limited number of things that the announcer says. So if you play a given character through an 8 round series of fights, you are going to hear the same thing over and over again. That all being said, this is a true classic of a game and many people have become quite fond of the sequels. So if you're into inexpensive fighters, or if you're a Soul Calibur fan who wants to see where it all began, this is a must have!</td><td>Still fun after all these years</td><td>1103414400</td><td>0</td><td>348</td><td>1559</td><td>20</td><td>4.4798850574712645</td><td>17.4</td><td>0.10174603</td><td>862</td></tr><tr><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>3453</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>02 6, 2002</td><td>B00000K125</td><td>N.

I may have recommended the other version, but this original is infinitely better, making the other one look like crap. My Playstation library certainly isn't big, but I know for a fact that you need this game! First off, the presentation is top-notch. You are treated to a couple 3D-animated FMV cutscenes. And then, BAM! As soon as the level begins, you wander at the amazingly colorful graphics, catchy lighthearted music, and as you start playing, the gameplay will get you hooked. The gameplay is somewhat basic. You can run, jump, Rev Roll (Like Sonic 2's spin dash move), and throw the Pac-Dots you eat to create small explosions. Fortunately, it actually makes for a very fun time, especially as you progress through the levels. There are lots of tweaks in each level, filling things up with neat detail and differentiation. It could be a little hard to judge distance for where you would land after jumping, but you'll get used to it quickly. The bosses are surprisingly VERY HARD! Unless you go onto YouTube or something to see how people beat the bosses, chances are, you'll be wasting a good amount of lives. But let me tell you this: King Galaxian is THE BEST BOSS LEVEL EVER! It changes the whole gameplay, letting you control a spaceship instead (a la Galaxian and Galaga) and shoot rows of alien ships! And then comes the boss itself, which still throws bad guys at ya, but also tries to suck your ship toward it (Galaga). Throughout all that, the music and even just the concept of the level makes up for what may possibly be a little frustrating boss fight. Overall, this is a true must-have. It's a game with some of the best music, graphics, and gameplay all around that a Pac-Man game could ever offer.</td><td>Your library is NOT complete without this!</td><td>1321056000</td><td>0</td><td>325</td><td>1508</td><td>16</td><td>4.64</td><td>20.3125</td><td>0.015144676</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>A3W4D8XOGLWUN5</td><td>3604</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>01 28, 2003</td><td>B00000K2G9</td><td>Michael Kerner</td><td>There are usually too many football video games that try to bring more special graphics displays, then the actual enjoyment of humor and feel of a actual enjoyable sports video game in the entire field of video games.

This was my first exposure to a survival horror game. Believe it or not, I actually didn't bother with the Resident Evil series until six years later, in the summer of 2005, which is when I played Resident Evil 2 for the very first time. Now, let's go back to 1999 for a moment. The world of 3D gaming was in full swing at that point in time. 1999 was a year when people were anxiously awaiting what the Playstation 2 would give us, while at the same time, we were appreciating what the original Playstation was offering. The original Playstation, as you may already know, is where the survival horror genre *really* became popular. Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and, the now underrated and unfortunately forgotten, Dino Crisis series. Over time, people haven't treated the Dino Crisis series with *nearly* as much respect as the Resident Evil and Silent Hill series. It probably has something to do with Dino Crisis 3 being a really bad game with horrible camera angles, which meant, after that failed experiment hit the market, people weren't interested in any more Dino Crisis games. But, you know, even before Dino Crisis 3 was released, people didn't respect the Dino Crisis series as much as the other survival horror games. I really have no idea why. Dinosaurs can be *just* as cool as zombies. Believe me. Perhaps it has something to do with the animation? Even though killing dinosaurs is fun and addicting, Capcom made killing zombies slightly more interesting, thanks mainly to better animation from pointing and shooting your guns at a zombies head. It just looks and feels better in Resident Evil.  This in NO WAY should be reason to avoid Dino Crisis. This also doesn't mean Dino Crisis is flawed in the shooting department. Both Resident Evil and Dino Crisis offer tons of enjoyment. TONS of enjoyment. They are just separate beasts. The original Dino Crisis is supposed to be about making the right decisions when it comes to either keeping your ammo and health in one place, or making the decision to bring the ammo and health with you. It's supposed to be about guessing whether or not the ammo or health will eventually be necessary as you progress through the game. However, on easy mode, none of this makes a difference. The game is *so* easy on easy mode, that you can literally get attacked by dinosaurs about five or six times before you even need one of those Med Pack M's (used to bring your health back to 100%). Seeing as how there aren't many dinosaurs in the game overall, you will only need to use one of these health packs maybe two or three times throughout the entire game. Dino Crisis is *that* easy!  This means you will only have to bring one or two Med Packs with you, and leave the rest behind. To be fair, you can't just mindlessly shoot every dinosaur you arrive to, because you aren't given a whole lot of ammo. Certainly not as much ammo is given to you compared to how many health packs are available throughout the journey. Despite that, running out of bullets probably won't ever be a problem.  Just make certain you avoid some of the weaker dinosaurs in the early parts of the game. That way you will have enough bullets for the bigger and deadlier dinosaurs in the later parts of the game (which obviously require more bullets to kill). You are given the ability to mix things together, to create dangerous darts. These darts are used to kill dinosaurs *very* quickly, sometimes in a single shot. The problem here is that, on easy mode, the game is so simple that mixing darts together isn't even important. You don't have to worry about dart-mixing on easy mode *at all*. You can simply shoot or avoid all the dinosaurs you come across on easy mode and not have to worry about dart-mixing EVER. That kind of ruins the whole \"survival horror\" aspect of the game.  You should have been required to use at least one or two of these darts. People criticize Dino Crisis 2 for being just a mindless shooting game where you have to kill as many dinosaurs as possible to progress to the next area and collect bigger guns, but the honest truth is, the original is a MUCH easier game overall because you can simply run past all the dinosaurs that stand in your way. You can't do that in the second game. You have to stand up to them and shoot. So Dino Crisis 2 is a harder game, in my opinion. Oh sure, you are given an option to up the difficulty (in both Dino Crisis games) but the problem here is that the difficulty goes up SIGNIFICANTLY, making the game nearly impossible. Another problem I have with the game is the amount of cutscenes. You CANNOT skip over them, so you are forced to watch almost every single one of them. Most of them are kind of boring because most of the cutscenes feature the main characters just talking to each other. Sometimes you will see a cool-looking dinosaur attacking something, though. But Capcom *really* should have given you an option to skip over the cutscenes like they did in the sequel, because most of them are flat-out boring. These conversations are supposed to create a spooky mood, but it doesn't work in my opinion. I also have a problem with the INCREDIBLE amount of puzzles you come across. I am not kidding, there's over 25 puzzles in this game. Some of them are just a matter of typing in the correct series of numbers, or the correct words to access the next area. Some of the puzzles are more along the lines of finding the right way to complete them, such as the puzzle where you're pushing these Up, Down, Left and Right buttons to figure out how to sucessfully lift up and put down boxes using a giant crane. These are extremely hard puzzles to figure out by yourself unless you have a walkthrough.  Once you figure them out, the sequence is exactly the same the next time you play the game, though.  They're not random like in Resident Evil 3. The game is also *very* heavy on searching for the correct key cards to gain access to the next part of the game, which can be annoying. Simply put, the game is dominated with puzzles and key cards, which are always required to access the next area.  A bit much, to say the least. Despite the above problems, Dino Crisis is STILL a pretty fun game because the dinosaurs are animated beautifully and the graphics as a whole are really good for 1999 as well. The actual gameplay has some problems mentioned above, but there's also plenty of action to be found. Also, the game is pretty scary and intense, and the dinosaurs are simply wonderful looking and it's interesting the way they can attack you because they attack differently each time. Sometimes they will bite at your arm, other times they will pick you up from off the ground, and more. Oh, and the music and sound effects are amazing.  Perhaps the best music and sound effects in a survival horror game ever. Instead of featuring melodic themes, you are treated to sound effects and musical notes that seem to play randomly, almost making it sound like improvised music, like something from a King Crimson record.  This means, if you listen to the music carefully, you can hear a bunch of unusual and creepy sound effects in the background.  You hear something different each time.  It's awesome, and works great.  It's not a typical soundtrack in any shape or form, even by survival horror standards.  It's so good. Overall, even though Dino Crisis has almost zero replay value, and too much time is spent running around inside a facility doing one puzzle after another (and collecting one key card after another) the game is worth the experience.  It's not a classic, just a nice game.</td><td>enjoyable, but not quite a classic</td><td>1169251200</td><td>1</td><td>1385</td><td>6278</td><td>75</td><td>4.532851985559566</td><td>18.466666666666665</td><td>0.023150714</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>3714</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>12 8, 2006</td><td>B00000K1VA</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is sometimes called the forgotten installment in the Resident Evil series.  Other people just call it the least popular.  Let's face it: all the attention went to Resident Evil 1 and 2 because those were the games that were revolutionary.  Those were the games that not only brought realistic, never-before-seen gameplay and 3D survival horror graphics to the original Playstation, but the Resident Evil series also made it *very* difficult for any imitators to come along and try to overtake the popularity and success of the Resident Evil series.  Capcom knew they had something amazing with this series, and that's why when video game fans think about being scared and trying to stay alive, the Resident Evil series *immediately* comes to mind. Now, here comes Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but, at the time of its release, this game didn't receive NEARLY as much attention as the previous two Resident Evil games.  Maybe it had something to do with the fact that video game fans were anticipating the upcoming release of the Playstation 2 in the year 1999, or maybe people thought the Resident Evil series was starting to run dry.  Nah, I highly doubt that second one is true.  Nemesis was just the Resident Evil game that didn't really stand out, despite the many positive reviews of the game that I'm sure you've read about.  Yes, the game is fantastic, and the fact that so many people would agree with me is more proof that the Resident Evil series was nowhere NEAR ready to be forgotten.  Not in this lifetime, baby.  It's just that Nemesis wasn't really a drastic jump forward in terms of innovation, like Resident Evil 2 was. I honestly believe, if you have an appetite for running around destroying zombies, that Nemesis is the *perfect* Resident Evil game for you.  I was completely taken by surprise as I continued to progress through the game and notice that the amount of zombies and other familiar enemies are absolutely LOADED almost everywhere you go.  Zombies left and right! At the very beginning of the game, when I looked inside that giant item box beside the typewriter, I couldn't believe Capcom was so generous as to give me more than enough ammo right from the beginning.  I really mean it- you receive a LOT of ammo from your item box.  After beating the game, I had a ton of ammo leftover.  Now, I realize people will probably look at this as a bad thing, and complain that lots of ammo greatly decreases the challenge and makes progressing through the game a cakewalk.  They'd also have a point if they wanted to complain that giving you loads of easily-available ammo straight from your item box doesn't really define \"strategy game\", since you aren't spending the majority of your time dodging enemies- you can simply walk up to them and shoot them and have *more* than enough ammo available for the next enemy you encounter.  They'd be absolutely correct, on both counts. Capcom is also pretty generous when it comes to those green herbs and first aid sprays.  You can find plenty of them throughout the game, just sitting around on the table or floor, making the challenge level go down even more.  Oh, and let's not forget that, in addition to having lots and lots of ammo generously offered to you, you also receive a few awesome weapons such as a machine gun and a shotgun straight from the beginning of the game.  Another thing- when you pick up, for example, handgun bullets, you actually receive a LOT of ammo.  I believe in Resident Evil 2 each of those orange packs of ammo contained about 15 bullets.  In this game, you receive, and I'm honestly not kidding, around 40-50 bullets per pack.  Capcom made running out of ammo something you will NEVER have to worry about. However, in a few ways, the challenge has been increased from Resident Evil 2.  For example, remember how slow the zombies would walk up to you in Resident Evil 2?  You could practically stand next to them and blast away, and not have to worry about taking any hits.  In Nemesis however, zombies are almost RUNNING at you, forcing you to turn around and allow yourself room to shoot.  This is awesome, because you won't know which zombies are slow pokes and which ones are speed runners until you see one on screen.  Oh, and thankfully a quick turnaround button has been included.  Press down on the directional pad + the run button to turn right around.  Very convenient button. This game is also much scarier, not to mention much bloodier, than the previous Resident Evil game.  The last time around, only *sometimes* zombies would break a window and try to attack you (along with crows, dogs and other dangerous enemies).  In Nemesis, not only do windows break all the time, but zombies can pop out of cars, jump down from buildings, and other incredible things.  Many times you will be caught completely off guard when it happens, too.  This is awesome. I love the fact that you actually go back to the police station from the previous Resident Evil game for a short while.  You go back, grab some things, and then head back out to the streets again, where most of the game takes place.  Interesting how the music from the main hall of the police station has remained exactly the same, and it's also interesting when you notice certain places blocked off that were very important to access in the previous game with Claire and Leon as your playable characters. You're probably wondering why the game is called Nemesis.  Well, Nemesis is the name of an enormous, persistent and dangerous maniac that, throughout the game, constantly tries to attack you.  He can either smack you with his arm, or shoot rockets at you.  This doesn't make the game as hard as you probably think, because most of the time you can simply run away from him. However, when he appears, get ready to either fight or run away.  Don't stand around too long.  Decide quickly! I want to set the record straight about something.  People writing reviews for this game will probably tell you that Nemesis chases you around from the beginning to the end of the game.  That's not exactly true.  Yes, it's true he will be a problem for you until the very last level but, you should know that Nemesis does NOT follow you around for the entirety of the game- he just appears *sometimes*, messes with you by following you into rooms and whatnot, and then he disappears for a while.  If you haven't played this game yet, some reviewers will have you convinced that Nemesis will be chasing you around ALL the time -nonstop- and this is NOT true. Probably the biggest challenge comes in the way of puzzle-solving.  Now, think back to Resident Evil 2.  What did you have?  You had three or four puzzles to solve.  And they were EASY!  In Nemesis, let's see, you have 10-12 puzzles to solve, and some of them simply can't be completed unless you're either a really excellent puzzle solver, or you look the answers up on the internet. Yes, I'm talking about that famous, dreaded water puzzle near the end of the game.  Honestly, the best way to successfully finish the darn puzzle is to just look up all the possible solutions on the internet, and then write them down.  I found seven different answers so far.  Don't feel ashamed for having to look up the answers.  This is one of those rare nearly-possible puzzles that you shouldn't feel bad about for not being able to understand it.  Don't get me wrong- once you find out how to do the puzzle, it's easy.  But if you happen to be mostly familiar with Resident Evil 2, and think you can go through the game on your own without a walkthrough, looking up help will probably be the best idea when you finally arrive to this puzzle.  You'll be glad when it's finished! The game has a good storyline too (well, by video game standards anyway) with excellent, action-packed cutscenes located throughout the game.  If you consider yourself an action-type person, you will enjoy some of these cutscenes a LOT.  I guarantee it.  One of them has something to do with a helicopter, and you'll love watching it. Also, Resident Evil 3 includes an infinite amount of ink ribbons to save your progress, and you now also have an option to skip over dialogue conversations and cutscenes by pressing the select button.  You didn't have this in the last game. Overall, I give this game the highest possible score you can give, and that would be 5 stars.  It truly deserves it.  The fact that you have to face about TWICE as many zombies this time around, and the fact that you are basically outside roaming the streets the entire time are major, major highlights for the game.  These streets are deadly.  Pick up this game today, and have fun.</td><td>zombies, zombies, and more zombies</td><td>1165536000</td><td>1</td><td>1595</td><td>7100</td><td>77</td><td>4.45141065830721</td><td>20.714285714285715</td><td>-0.042778477</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>3766</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>11 30, 2002</td><td>B00000K2R6</td><td>N.

The Dreamcast VMU (Visual Memory Unit) is a step ahead in designing home system memory cards.  Included is a small LCD screen with working buttons to play mini-games along with other features (for example raising Chaos in Sonic Adventure or playing a Pac-Man type game with Namco Museum).  You can take the top off the VMU and transfer files into another VMU or link it up to play mini-games together.  The VMU can hold up to 200 blocks of memory, and while this may seem like a lot, most of Sega's 2K2 sports titles take just about 200 blocks of memory just to save options let alone a team season.  Not to mention that after a while the battery life of the VMU LCD screen will die, and that happens quicker than expected, but the LCD screen isn't necessarily needed if your just using the VMU as a memory card and nothing more.  All in all, I would recommend at least 3 or 4 VMU's for Dreamcast owners; they're cheap and affordable and you can still find them at game retailers.</td><td>Despite it's flaws, it's still the best memory card yet</td><td>1038614400</td><td>1</td><td>217</td><td>935</td><td>8</td><td>4.308755760368664</td><td>27.125</td><td>-0.0125</td><td>805</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>3817</td><td>2.0</td><td>8</td><td>false</td><td>08 12, 2006</td><td>B00000K2R4</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Finally, Sega releases a video game system that rises above mediocrity!  Sega is famous for all kinds of failed (and embarrassing) video game consoles they brought to the world, but this time they actually \"kind of\" got it right with the Dreamcast. Unfortunately, Sega made a gigantic mistake that almost immediately brought down any chance of the Dreamcast becoming a success.  They chose to release the Dreamcast in late 1999.  Gaming fans vividly remember what happened to the Sega Saturn just a couple years before, and people weren't going to be fooled again.  This was now or never for Sega.  If the Dreamcast failed, Sega would be gone from the hardware market forever. The release date for the Dreamcast was getting closer and closer.  It was in September of 1999.  People were still very happy with their Playstation One because 1999 was one of Sony's highlights for spectacular and revolutionary gaming.  That wasn't the only thing going on.  Sony fans were also anticipating the release of the Playstation 2, which was guaranteed to become the dominant console thanks to the relentless power and popularity the Playstation One was responsible for.  It was during this time Sony was far and away the most powerful company in the video game business.  Sega saw trouble ahead but continued to move forward with the expected Dreamcast release date. Nintendo was also very much alive and in the big picture with the Gamecube.  Nintendo was content on making sure their fans would NOT be disappointed with the Gamecube the way they were with the N64.  Nintendo fans are loyal.  *Nothing* can knock out Nintendo.  Nintendo recognized their mistake with the N64 and knew they could make it right again.  They knew they could give the Playstation 2 a run for its money (and looking back, Nintendo did just that). And so, the release date for the Dreamcast arrived.  With Nintendo and Sony on top of their game, what would happen?  What would happen to Sega?  The Dreamcast would hit the market and... nothing.  No sound.  No noise.  So little was said about the Dreamcast on the release date that it was like Sega had died right then and there.  An eerie silence for a company that gave the world Sonic the Hedgehog. The Dreamcast failed because there were already more than enough successful gaming consoles on the market in 1999, and people didn't want the Dreamcast to interfere with the superior, soon-to-be-released Sony and Nintendo gaming systems.  Sega also failed because of their long, frustrating history of ripping people off with unsatisfactory video game systems (such as the Sega CD and Sega Saturn).  Sega would fool people into thinking they had something extraordinary in the works... only to end up not supporting it.  They had trouble supporting the video game consoles they created and would often leave people with failed attempts and false hopes.  Sega would always fall asleep on the job.  This would happen time and time again, with Sega hoping the brain-dead masses would buy their average, incomplete gaming consoles.  It's like the people who worked for Sega would always say \"let's start something and not finish it\". When Sega failed YET AGAIN with the Saturn, people finally couldn't TAKE anymore.  Anyone who was still a Sega fan by that point pretty much lost all hope.  Sega was now the enemy and they had to go.  A gaming console needs a giant selection of games, and unfortunately Sega only understood that ONE TIME in their lackluster history (with the Genesis).  Every other console they released only had a few classics to choose from among a bunch of average games. In the case of the Dreamcast, Sega tried to support it but it was too late.  Sony had defeated them.  Sony had defeated BOTH the Saturn and the Dreamcast with the overpowering success of the Playstation One.  Hard to believe but it's true: the Playstation One knocked out BOTH the Saturn and the Dreamcast  off the market, making both of those consoles nothing more than a disappointing memory for Sega fans. In 1999, Sega knew they wouldn't be able to compete with the Playstation 2, so they finally did the right thing in early 2001 by announcing that they would never again make another video game console.  Sega was DONE.  They admitted defeat.  That, my friends, made milions and millions of people very happy.  No more junk on the market.  That announcement was the best thing that could have happened, and if you happened to glance outside that day you would have noticed the sun smiling down on everyone. That meant no more arrogant Sega promotion.  I used to hate the way Sega would always promote their games by putting down Nintendo and Sony.  Now I can laugh at it.  Sega really thought they could trick people into buying their crappy games by constantly making fun of Nintendo and Sony.  Didn't work.  Nintendo and Sony fans are too smart and considerate for that immature nonsense.  I bet everyone responsible for the Playstation's creation were laughing in piles of money over the \"fly, play thing, fly\" commercial that Sega created in an attempt to make Sony look second-rate.  Ha!  That ugly, gray-colored box destroyed both the Saturn and the Dreamcast, and I hope Sega fans never forget it. It's almost 2007 and people are STILL talking about the Gamecube and Playstation 2.  Why?  Because they are successful video game consoles.  People will look back and REMEMBER them as successful consoles.  No one remembers that the Dreamcast tried to compete with them at one point.  People forgot the Dreamcast even EXISTED when the year 2002 came around.  Sega's video game consoles immediately became dated and forgettable once companies stopped making games for them.  If Sega had put less energy into putting down the competition and more energy into offering their customers *complete* and enjoyable gaming consoles, maybe they'd still be around today.  As it stands, they deserved to watch Nintendo and Sony destroy them.  Nintendo and Sony didn't have to stoop to dirty tactics to win over fans and the world is now a better place. With the release of Nintendo's new revolutionary Wii system coming to America this November, along with the Playstation 3, we don't have to laugh at Sega's silly attempt to compete only to end up being the laughing stock of the world.

I am incredibly disappointed that after reading so many positive reviews claiming Tekken 3 to not only be a significant improvement over the previous two Tekken games, but also tagged \"the ultimate tournament fighter\" that the actual game would turn out to be *so* underwhelming. Tekken 3 really surprised me. But don't take that as a compliment. I went into Tekken 3 with hardly any experience with fighting games whatsoever. I took a break for 10 years with tournament fighters after all those lousy 2D Mortal Kombat games brought me to tears. Back then I figured \"okay, either I don't like fighting games or maybe I just don't like the Mortal Kombat series\". This was when Mortal Kombat 2 and 3 were popular on the Super NES and Genesis. A lot can change with a human being in 10 years. We grow older, we decide we want to learn about life and wonder where we came from, and we develop an apprecation for the things we have and the people who are in our lives. To put it simply, we're thankful to be alive and feel good. But in some situations, things can remain EXACTLY the same. All those extreme feelings of hatred returned to me immediately after only 5 minutes with Tekken 3. It was the exact same feeling of hopelessness I encountered with the Mortal Kombat series. I really have no idea what went wrong. No, not with the game, I mean, what went wrong with ME. Seeing as how I love watching people fight and kick butt on TV shows and movies, I figured it was only natural that the fighting style in the world of video games would appeal to me. Appeal to me a LOT. That was my assumption. But apparently it STILL hasn't happened. Tekken 3 was supposed to help me wash away all the bad memories of playing old Mortal Kombat games and give me a fresh start and hopefully help me develop an appreciation for the ever-popular genre of games known as \"tournament fighters\". Nope. It's really disappointing to me to find out that Tekken 3 is just as bad as the rest of the fighters I've played, and basically the same thing but with improved graphics, for that matter. All fighting games feel the same to me. It doesn't even matter if they are 2D or 3D fighters. Tekken 3, despite all the positive reviews, does NOT appeal to me whatsoever. The fighting is really clunky, and it seems each fighter delivers very basic and boring moves to each other. It's not interesting or inspiring at ALL to me. It's boring to watch, and even more boring to play. Why is it so much fun when they fight this way in movies but *not* interesting when it's time to do the same thing in a video game? I have no idea. If you want to pull off the really impressive looking moves in Tekken 3, you have to press a bunch of buttons on the controller in a really complicated way in order to complete a move that COULD have been made *much* easier with a very simple and quick sequence of buttons. Strong emphasis on the word \"simple\". Many moves actually require you to press the Circle button, and then jump over to the Square button. How is someone supposed to easily master this? Going from Circle to Square is NOT easy. You see, for each of the ten characters in the game, they have major power moves that are very important to master because these are the moves that are supposed to cause the most damage to an opponent. However, many of these moves are incredibly difficult and sophisticated to pull off, and this is a *really* bad thing because the company responsible for this game apparently doesn't understand the importance of making a fighting game easy to master for everyone, of all ages. That way, young and old people alike can appreciate the Tekken style. It really bothers me how ALL of the developers who release fighting games assume the player is automatically completely aware how to play the game. They assume this *every single time* they release a fighting game. Developers assume everyone who plays these kind of games will be able to understand them instantly. We're supposed to be gifted players when it comes to understanding how to successfully pull off any number of lengthy and devestating combos to our opponents. We're supposed to have enough time to press really awkward button combinations on the Playstation controller during a fast-paced and intense fighting match. Not just combos either- regular moves too. We're supposed to have enough patience to continue trying the same fight over and over as we die a million times and the frustration factor increases significantly, and we realize just how IMPOSSIBLE these kind of games are. Well, I have news for every developer out there: many of us have a really difficult time with games like this. Not everyone who plays fighting games should automatically be expected to be a skilled player. Not all of us hang out at local arcades wasting tons of quarters as we try and perfect our skills. Some of us are, you know, average \"normal\" gamers who just like to have fun. The developers of tournament fighters NEVER could understand this, and years later, they still can't understand what it's like to have fun. We shouldn't have to be a genius to play a fighting game. Not all of us can press the EXACT moves at the EXACT moment and win fights. Maybe one day a tournament fighter will be invented for a gaming console that will be specifically designed to be playable for people who struggle with them. Maybe one day... Other things I don't like about Tekken 3. Despite having excellent graphics, the music is a bunch of horrible, repetitive techno sounds that hardly make me feel compelled to continue playing the game. Oh, and by the way, even though the graphics are really a notch above the rest, there's absolutely no reason to jump with joy when looking at them. Since the fighting is just as basic and uninspiring as that of, oh I don't know, Killer Instinct (another terrible game) you quickly stop caring about how the game looks. In fact, I'd say the fighting engine is EXACTLY like that old Super Nintendo game Killer Instinct. Extremely uninteresting. When someone throws a punch, it's so boring to watch that you just don't care about it. That's what Tekken 3 is all about. Having a fighting engine that's so boring you don't even care if you win or lose. I'm disappointed. That's the only thing I can say at the moment. Maybe one day an easy tournament fighter will hit the market where the main purpose of the game is to have the computer opponents move along at a reasonable pace for all the normal people out there who constantly struggle with fighting games. A game that will give people the much needed time and patience to put a move on their opponent. A game where you aren't expected to hurry up just to deliver a simple move. Somehow, despite hundreds of tournament fighters that will eventually hit stores, I doubt this will ever happen. I will never buy another tournament fighter again.

With Dreamcast, Sega moves beyond Sonic into a heavily graphic and net-savvy arcade machine. Probably the biggest difference between the Dreamcast and its competitors is the built in 56k modem. This allows Dreamcast owners to log on to the net, surf the web, and fight other opponents head to head. This opens up a HUGE opportunity for finding playmates that until now was restricted to computer gamers. The web surfing ability only sweetens the deal, although like WebTV, there is no ability to download. It's not for free - ... - but for a household that is currently not on the Internet, the price gets both the web access and unlimited gameplay. You also need to buy a keyboard if you wish to do any web work. Like the Sony Playstation, the Dreamcast will play audio CDs. Unlike the Playstation 2, it will not play DVDs, however. Also, while the Playstation 2 can play all Playstation games (since both are CD based) the Sega Dreamcast cannot play older Sega games. Popular Sega games tend to be arcade or fighting games - Rayman 2, Street Fighter Alpha 3. The incredibly high polygon draw rate (three million polygons per second) means that these games fly, giving great gameplay. Even though this is equipped with a 12x CD player, it's still slower than a cartridge system like the N64. On the up-side, CDs are cheaper than cartridges, and can hold a lot more information on them, leading to more involved games. I'm personally not a huge Dreamcast fan - the types of games available on it aren't ones that tend to appeal to me - but my arcade and fighting loving friends enjoy it a great deal.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>How complicated must it be for Sega to make a game on a console that's still in development at the same time? And yet, the final game is a smash hit that happens to be pretty top-notch. They've pulled through then, I guess. The game lets you choose to play as 6 different characters (However, you unlock them by playing as Sonic first). We have Sonic (of course), Tails, Amy, Knuckles, E103 Omega, and....Big the Cat...Each of the characters have their own gameplay mechanics, as well as goals and certain levels. Below is the fun factor for each character. Sonic - The levels are actually pretty straightforward. You simply go from start to finish. And boy was it fun.. It's actually pretty close to the Genesis Sonic games, but in 3D. Collect rings, bash robots, you know..The good stuff. Plus, there are some new level-specific gameplay mechanics included, like Twinkle Park's bumper car riding, and Sky Chase's airplane combat! You may as well buy this game just for Sonic alone. After all, as the title character, he has the most levels to go through. Tails - More or less like Sonic's gameplay except he has to race Sonic (later, Eggman, in Speed Highway) in each level. It's not as bad as it may sound, because it only just keeps the pace going, which is great, and don't you think it's kind of exciting to find shortcuts when flying? Knuckles - Rather than going from start to finish, Knuckles has to find 3 Emeralds in each level. So how do you do so? You glide around the place and see if an Emerald is picked up on a radar (REALLY helpful), and they could be hidden in enemies or other places. The only minor (And only MINOR) downside with Knuckles is that there are only about 1 (or 2?) Emeralds throughout the game that could only be found by digging into the ground. I was expecting Knuckles's digging upgrade to be used a bit more specifically for finding Emeralds. Amy - She isn't as fast as the above 3 characters, but she still isn't a bad pick. Although having the same robot chase her throughout levels is a little cringe-inducing, Amy plays pretty well, as she can attack with her massive hammer. E103 Omega - Alright. Who expected a robot to be playable in a Sonic game? I certainly haven't, but I'm glad I am. Omega's gameplay involves massive deals of weaponry, as well as being able to hover later on, and do certain tasks in the levels. In Final Egg, for example, you must destroy Sonic dolls. In Emerald Coast, you catch Froggy. In other levels, you must go destoy other Omega robots! I absolutely love playing as this thing, as much as I love playing as the first 3 characters. Big - Big is a pretty lame downside to this game. He's slow, and you have to go fishing for things. It's as fun as described, and I certainly don't want to go back to playing as him. Sadly, you have to beat the game as all characters if you want to fight the actual last boss, Perfect Chaos, so........ That pretty much covers up the characters. As for everything else, the level design is magnificent and lovingly crafted. Plus, the graphics are awesome for the time, and the soundtrack rocks! However, Sonic Adventure is not without flaws. The cutscenes aren't amazing, and while the story is nicely done, some bits of dialogue are a bother (THAT'S A CHAOS EMERALD! - Says Knuckles as 2 Chaos Emeralds have been spotted). Oh, yeah, and there's Big the Cat. Nevertheless, these are, of course, minor problems, as the game is so much fun that you'd hardly think about them.</td><td>Sonic's major step into 3D</td><td>1334966400</td><td>0</td><td>628</td><td>2850</td><td>53</td><td>4.538216560509555</td><td>11.849056603773585</td><td>0.10648719</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>4052</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>01 24, 2002</td><td>B00000K3X9</td><td>N.

Sonic returns alongside his old buds Tails and Knuckles with some other characters to once again battle Dr. Robotnik.  While you can tell this game was designed primarily for younger kids, older gamers will love playing Sonic Adventure.  The levels are massive, the graphics are unbelieveable, and the virtual pet Chao is a cool addition to an allready awesome game.  The only problem is the camera angle can get awkward very quickly on certain levels, causing you to misjudge your distance when you jump and leading to frustrating deaths, but when you get the hang of it, it becomes simple.

On one hand, it's great for a sequel. People who played DK1 will easily be able to pick up on moving units, building rooms,  lining corridors with traps. The graphics are better in the sense that  they're more geared towards future development. Instead of pixel-based  graphics, the creatures and rooms are now drawn with polygons. While that  makes some of the monsters look clumsy, it does mean that future graphics  will be much smoother and cleaner. Going down into your dungeon by  possessing a creature does not cause the creatures to turn into a cloud of  dots - the rooms you roam through are still crisp and easy to see. Roaming  through your own dungeons is one of the true pleasures of this game,  too! There are only a few extra rooms - you'd have hoped for much more  from a sequel that took this long to make. The casino is neat, if only  because a jackpot-winning minion starts dancing and singing when he wins.  (Disco Inferno!) Rooms have better graphics, though. The hen-houses in  the hatchery, the on-wall bookshelves and torture racks, everything shows a  subtle touch. If choosing between DK1 and DK2, I'd definitely recommend  people get this game. The challenges and gameplay in DK2 are better than  DK1, and DK1 has many new extra features like Pet Dungeons. New players  will appreciate having a well crafted game that is a fun challenge, while  experienced players will appreciate the subtle differences between the old  and new version.

Not that many of them can have a strong sense of enjoyment in the golf world, where everyone wants a more serious side in the sports world with football, and basketball. However, Nintendo seemed to hit the nail on the head with their 2000 creation. With Mario Golf, the game consists of the start of four golfers, including Baby Mario, Peach, and a couple of others. Throughout the game, you can access the Get Character mode, which can help you challenge other characters like Mario, Bowser, and Yoshi. Once you win the character, you also need them, the harder the challenger in the round. It is also important in the Tournament mode, where you can also earn enough points toward newer golf courses and challenging holes in the process. Each course reflecting on the cute, Mario Brothers themed style, which makes it appealing to all ages old and young, where the other games don't seem to have that sense of enjoyment. Although Nintendo stopped making games for the Nintendo 64, Mario Golf is only one of the very few sports games I highly recommend for the system.

Like Pharoh and Caesar III, this is a game ofdesigning buildings and walkways to keep your people happy. In this case the people are not residents, although with some staying in your park for 60 days or more, you have to wonder where they are sleeping! And, like all games, you start with rather easy missions and work your way forward. You begin by planning walkways that make sense for your visitors, and putting down inexpensive but entertaining rides. Each visitor has his or her own sense of what's fun - something exciting, something laid back, something truly wild or something mild. You need to set up food, drink and restrooms, and put out benches and trashcans. You hire repairmen, sweepers, entertainers, and security folk. Vandalism can strike, and rides can break down. The game, once set up well, can almost run itself. Your various minions roam around your park, cleaning and fixing items. You earn money based on quite a few variables - how much you charge at the gate, how much you charge for food, how much you charge for each ride. Rain comes and visitors are now buying umbrellas, and avoiding the open rides. Marketing campaigns can help your draw, although coupons might affect profits short-term. There are great graphs to help you manage the economics of your strategy, and the graphics themselves are quite fun! The merry-go-round spins, the roller-coaster cars fill with little people and go around the tracks. You can customize colors, add statuary, research new theme decorations like Egyptian and Roman buildings. You can raise and lower terrain, building raised walkways and underground roller coaster tunnels. The game will run quite well on a low-end system, which can't be said for its rival, SimThemePark. It's easy to use, and quite satisfying to play. You can name the park, name each ride, and even name each individual visitor! It's easy to get attached to your creation, and sit for hours tweaking it. The game was entertaining both for me and for my 11 year old son. We both found the options varied and fun. My son especially enjoyed when you accidentially cranked a roller-coaster's speed up too high - the practice run would set the cars careening off the track, warning you to decrease the speed a bit! Our only complaint has to do with item placement - if you raise and then lower a piece of land, it double-charges you for each phase of the change. There isn't really an undo feature, so if you make a mistake (which can be easy, sometimes) there is no simple way to just go back to your previous state. With blocks of land easily hid behind other blocks (despite their many view options), you often have to lower whole regions of land simply to \"get to\" the blocked one, wasting hundreds of dollars. Also, with no 'fast forward', you often have to go eat dinner or watch a movie before your park, which has met the 'winning criteria', finally gets through the years required for the trophy. It'll run itself all the while, but it can get quite tedious. With that small amount of inconvenience, however, this is a great game for computer users of all ages, and with the varied terrains available, one able to always offer a new challenge!</td><td>It's the Little Bugs that Bother Me</td><td>961286400</td><td>1</td><td>572</td><td>2690</td><td>30</td><td>4.7027972027972025</td><td>19.066666666666666</td><td>0.13610901</td><td>862</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>4680</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>12 31, 2010</td><td>B00001IVLY</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>StarCraft stands the test of time as a strategy game extraordinaire. It is not just the trio of the zerg, protoss, and terran with their well balanced arsenals. It is the whole plot and atmosphere which shine. StarCraft was one of the first strategy games I played where I got swept up into the storyline and became fond of the individual character types. Even many years later I still refer to the \"zerglings\" and remember the behavior of the individual troop types. The game is incredibly fun just in single player mode, moving through the missions, refining and perfecting your skill with each of the three groups. Where it shines for me, though, is when you take it into multiplayer and take on other humans. The possibilities are pretty much endless. With all the troop types, and the various ways to use them, you can always find a fresh, interesting challenge. We definitely own games that we played once, had a fun time doing so, and then put the game away never to be touched again. We have games that we wrote five star reviews when they came out but barely remember them several years later. This is NOT the case with StarCraft. We adored it when it came out, we kept playing it, and even years later we are strong advocates of the game. Perhaps the only trouble you could have in modern times is that, because the game was released for Windows 95 and Windows NT, you might have difficulties playing the game on a just-released system. The game is, after all, from 1997. However, I just tested the game out on my 2010 laptop which is running Windows Vista. It ran without a problem. I logged into Battle.net and there were currently 137 StarCraft games running! I'm not sure how many other 13 year old games you could find this kind of enthusiasm for. Are there any downsides? Sure, the graphics are a little blocky compared with current high def games. Still, the minute I launched into my Zerg world, I was oblivious to any minor issues with the older resolution. The underlying plot and gameplay were all there. The same is just *fun*. Highly recommended! We purchased StarCraft with our own funds.</td><td>Stands the Test of Time</td><td>1293753600</td><td>1</td><td>376</td><td>1735</td><td>25</td><td>4.61436170212766</td><td>15.04</td><td>0.055751488</td><td>862</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>4771</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>02 21, 2009</td><td>B00000PLUW</td><td>Bryan</td><td>It's VERY disappointing to me personally that people insist on moving forward when it comes to video games and quickly putting the gaming consoles of the past behind them forever. Come on, I grew up in the days of the NES when I was a child in the late 80's and early 90's.  I was forced to play the same few games over and over for *years* because there wasn't much in the way of variety back in those days. But you know what?  I wasn't angry about that.  Not at all.  This meant I learned to appreciate games for a LOT more than just a couple hours of fun.  I learned to accept video games back then for all the graphical flaws I encountered, or any kind of gameplay problem.  I learned to IGNORE all that stuff and just have fun playing the GAME and having a great time. I see kids today who look absolutely *determined* to forget about the Playstation 1 and 2 and buy whatever new video game console is cool these days.  Let me tell you something- back in the 90's, for at least four years, it was considered VERY cool to own a Playstation 1.  This is because game companies kept pumping out one wonderful game after another. Sure, there were some average games on the PS1, and plenty of crappy games as well.  But the same can be said for ANY video game console.  Why should we focus on the less than spectacular games when reviewing a video game system anyway?  It's completely pointless because ALL consoles have their share of average and terrible games.  Every single one of them. Sony's successful Playstation console was just EXCELLENT if you ask me.  Making the decision to keep the PS1 for over 12 years now and not only play the console, but keep the PS1 HOOKED UP to my TV for all these years really means the games must have been good.  And they *are* good.  REALLY good games. In addition to having a CD player built into the Playstation console for all your music needs, I have to say the CD player is actually a step above most CD players out there because the one built into the PS1 is apparently a heavy duty player that can actually play through HEAVILY scratched discs without a problem. I put in an old Stooges CD called Fun House that's almost unplayable on other CD players, but it works brilliantly in the PS1.  Honestly, the music CDs work a lot better in the PS1 than they do in an actual Sony CD player!  I had a couple Sony CD players that never played the discs right so in the trash without hesitation THOSE CD players went. How about memory cards?  You can buy a memory card for less than 5 bucks for your PS1 console.  I am totally serious about that.  What a FANTASTIC price to store your memory for your many video game adventures.  Trust me, you'll need a memory card for all the fairly long games available for the PS1. I'm also SICK TO DEATH of all these complicated video games out there today that require pressing TOO MANY buttons just to make the character perform an action that can *easily* be mastered on the Playstation 1.  No, you do NOT need extreme and precise accuracy just to shoot a guy in the arm when you can perform a similar action playing a first person shooter on the PS1, such as the Medal of Honor series. That leads us to the PS1 controller.  It's a *perfect* controller in every single way.  You can easily remember the buttons on the controller, and where they are located in critical moments so you won't make any mistakes. Most importantly, it's VERY easy to allow your fingers to reach over to another button and press it easily without any inconvenience.  I'm talking about NO problems doing so.  This... THIS is why the PS1 is a brilliant video game system.  No annoying analog sticks getting in the way of your commands.  No awkwardly placed buttons on the controller making your gaming adventure turn into a nightmare.  NONE OF THAT! All these games people criticize today for being old and unplayable such as the Silent Hill and Resident Evil series... give me a *break*.  You have to give these kind of games a chance so your brain and fingers can learn to adjust to the way they play, and I *promise* you'll learn to find that moving your character around is very easy.  It's all about giving things a chance and taking the time to understand the way they are. The Playstation 1 has MANY *extremely* good games available that are pretty affordable and definitely playable.  Sure, most of the games are slightly shorter than the games you will find on the Wii, PS3, or Xbox, but who cares?  You'll have so much fun playing them that you'll probably be back to play through them again, I guarantee it.  I must have played through Silent Hill and Castlevania: SOTN over 100 times. And no, it's NOT just RPG games that are worth playing either.  PLENTY of shooting games that you'll have a surprising amount of fun playing through, such as the Medal of Honor and Resident Evil series, Silent Hill, Dino Crisis 2, Quake II, Doom, MDK, all kinds of Mega Man games, and who knows what else.  There's just *so many games* to choose through, games that should be memorable for years and years and YEARS!  Perhaps the very best game on the Playstation is a platform/adventure game called Spyro the Dragon.  The best game EVER made maybe? Simply put- if you ignorantly write off the Playstation 1 for being old and outdated and assume that means the games are unplayable, you are flat out *wrong* in my eyes.  All this fancy digital, high def, high resolution stuff available for your televisions *just* to play a video game makes me sick to my stomach.  It means it's alright for video games to be bad because as long as they LOOK good, people will buy them anyway.  Absolutely disgusting.  Buy the PS1 and start a collection of EXCITING games. Oh, and that leads me to conclude that the coolest, neatest, greatest thing about the Playstation 1 console is that you can buy one for under 20 bucks.  20 bucks for HOURS of exciting gameplay?

This gave it the ability to hold more information than a normal cartridge game ... and many games came in multiple CD packs. This equalled longer gameplay and more complexity than the N64 or Sega systems. The Playstation One is a smaller version of the same unit - portable and soon to come out with a portable LCD screen. Both play any game from the Playstation One library. While CDs do hold more data than cartridges, they load a bit more slowly, so often there is a second lag between scenes as the new scene loads into memory. While Nintendo games tend to be pixel based, most Playstation games are polygon based, taking advantage of the Playstation's 360,000 polygons/sec speed. This tends to make images sharper and scaleable. When something moves towards you it's easy to calculate polygons, compared to expanding pixels. There is a good sized library of games for the Playstation - quite a few racing games, plus the Tomb Raider series, the Final Fantasy series, Abe, Spyro the Dragon, and more. The games for the Playstation tend to be for teenagers and adults. We've had a Playstation since it first came out, and for racing and sports games it is incredible. We find we use the N64 far more often when kids are around wanting to play something.

You could read my review of it for more details on that; I gave it three stars. Anyway, not only did I decide to get this game for my Playstation in hopes of it playing better, but I got it in brand new-condition when I could've simply purchased a used copy! Fortunately, this game was worth every penny. UmJammer Lammy follows the formula of Parappa the Rapper in which you press buttons as they appear on the top of the screen, following with the rhythm. This time, instead of rapping, you are playing guitar riffs (but the guitar's in your miiiinddd!!!), but the actual gameplay really isn't different. It's the same rhythmic press Square-Circle-L-Triangle-or-whatever-else-in-order-and-with-proper-timing shtick that made people hail Parappa as the first modern rhythm game. And they have every right to; this is a lot of fun! And the fun is backed up by the wacky, imaginative scenarios Lammy gets herself into and the catchy music that serves as the game's seven levels. The songs are actually not as memorable as those of Parappa, but they're still fun in their own right (although the lyrics can sometimes be cringe-inducing). And yes, the control and timing work well! I mean, sure, the game may still inaccurately down/uprank you at a few instances, but I had never flat-out gotten a Game Over from that. In fact, during my second playthrough, I've only ever had to replay a level two times total. The game does progressively grow more and more challenging, but not to the point where it's unfair or impossible. What UmJammer Lammy does have that's better than in Parappa, though, is the overall presentation. Let me start out by saying that the character Parappa has had it way too easy! All he did in his game was learn karate, get a driver's license, sell at a flea market, bake a cake, and....cut in line to the bathroom......Meanwhile, Lammy has to put out a fire, calm God knows how many babies, fly a plane, and visit he-I mean an island! ALL THAT WHILE SHE HAS FIFTEEN MINUTES TO GET TO HER OWN CONCERT!!! The stakes are definitely much higher than before, and I think that helps makes things more interesting, to say the least. Within that, I think the execution here is well improved, too, as the animation is finely done, the voice acting is better, and the writing is considerably less corny and even has a sense of humor that's on par with cartoon shows. I think it's time I talk about the other game modes before I completely wrap this review up; these are mainly suited for co-op or versus multiplayer, in which one player plays as Lammy while the other is a monochrome counterpart, or, if you beat the game, it could be Lammy and PARAPPA THE RAPPER! Yes, that's right! After beating the main game, you could play a special campaign playing as Parappa himself, and this mode even has its own cutscenes! Granted, they're not at all related to Lammy's side of the story, but they are entertaining in their own right. Not to mention, the songs/levels have been changed up exclusively for Parappa to the point where song lyrics are different. All in all, with great musical gameplay cues and a cartoon-like sense of imagination and personality, UmJammer Lammy is absolutely worth picking up, especially considering that&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/the-original-Playstation-version-of-Parappa-the-Rapper/dp/B00002STOT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">the original Playstation version of Parappa the Rapper</a>&nbsp;costs way more for a used copy.</td><td>Leave it to Lammy!!</td><td>1419724800</td><td>1</td><td>635</td><td>3332</td><td>35</td><td>5.247244094488189</td><td>18.142857142857142</td><td>0.12725075</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>4935</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>05 4, 2002</td><td>B00001QED2</td><td>N.

Other games with skateboarding like Sony's Xtreme series (2Xtreme, 3Xtreme, etc...) incorporated skateboarding, but the results were lackluster at best.  What made Tony Hawk go above and beyond your average extreme sports games was that there was an added realism incorporated with easy to pull moves and tricks that rounded out a real fun package.  This game was revolutionary at its time, and it spawned two sequels that topped the original, and a host of imitators that still can't match the original Tony Hawk.  The soundtrack is worth noting as well; Primus, Dead Kennedys, Suicidal Tendencies, and the Suicide Machines lend some tracks making the game even more enjoyable.  If you have never played the original Tony Hawk, but have played the sequels, chances are you won't like this, but no matter how you look at it, the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater is a piece of modern video game history.</td><td>The original unexpected classic</td><td>1020470400</td><td>0</td><td>186</td><td>889</td><td>10</td><td>4.779569892473118</td><td>18.6</td><td>0.14384058</td><td>805</td></tr><tr><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>4975</td><td>4.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>12 12, 2002</td><td>B00001QED5</td><td>N.

The PS1 and N64 conversions took much longer than expected to be released, and fans of the PC game anxiously awaiting the home versions were a little worried about the quality of the home system versions.  When Quake 2 hit the PS1, those fears were dead in the dirt.  Activision, Hammerhead, and Id all did a fantastic job bringing Quake 2 to the PS1 while keeping a surprisingly smooth frame rate (although the graphics aren't as good as its PC counterpart, but that was expected) and the unabashed violent addictive gameplay remains intact.  The game makes excellent use of the PS1's Dual Shock controller; the controls are easy and every button is to be used.  While some parts can be frustrating and the game has a rather steep learning curve, Quake 2 is still undeniably fun.  Those still holding on to they're PS1's can find this bad boy at a rather cheap price and have a great time with this near classic FPS.</td><td>A great bit of fun on the good 'ol PS1</td><td>1039651200</td><td>1</td><td>196</td><td>893</td><td>8</td><td>4.5561224489795915</td><td>24.5</td><td>0.04212963</td><td>805</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>4984</td><td>5.0</td><td>9</td><td>false</td><td>03 16, 2007</td><td>B00001QED5</td><td>Bryan</td><td>This is a review for the Playstation version of Quake II. Quake was a very popular and influential first-person shooter series on the PC, and I'm happy to report that everything you love about the series there has remained almost exactly the same on the Playstation console. I can't help but compare Quake II to Medal of Honor because MoH was the very first first-person shooter I ever owned.  The controls in Quake II are almost exactly the same, except in Quake II, the L1 and R1 buttons on the Playstation controller are used to move your target up and down.  The target is the little white thing that permanently stays in the middle of the screen.  It's used to line up the perfect kill shot.  Learning to use this target properly will probably take about a half hour because, to be totally honest with you, it's not exactly the easiest way to find and eliminate enemies.  If you think this control system is a bit strange, I won't disagree.  You'll learn to adjust to it, though.  Give the game time to sink in. First let me mention that, despite what people might say, you CAN in fact use a regular old Playstation controller for this game.  That's what I'm using right now, in fact.  I don't care about all these Dual Shock and Analog controllers that are supposed to make the gaming experience superior because the reality is that a regular controller works just fine.  Sorry, but using a directional pad to play first-person shooters is MUCH easier for me.  I need to hit the \"Up\" button to walk, and the X button to shoot.  That's exactly what Quake II allows me to do. After a good 30 minutes with the game, I think the controls are almost perfect.  I have no problem at all controlling the game.  Furthermore, the framerate is lightning fast and incredibly smooth.  How many games with a SMOOTH and near-perfect framerate can you find on your Playstation?  Okay, there's Medal of Honor and tons of third-person shooters (like the Resident Evil series) in addition to lots of 2D adventure games (such as Mega Man X4 and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night). The honest truth is that many games have choppy framerate issues that make it extremely tough to enjoy a game.  Many games are designed where you can actually get STUCK to the side of a wall when going around a corner (Duke Nukem anyone?).  Not to mention many games have an unresponsive button system (you press a button and nothing happens or your command is delayed a couple seconds- ANNOYING!). Quake II does NOT have any of these problems.  It somehow manages to avoid all the problems that many games have a nasty habit of having and instead gives us a sweet-looking and easily playable game. The enemies you encounter in Quake II are pretty smart.  If they see you, they will keep shooting until you die.  However, I found a trick you can do to fool the enemies.  Walk up next to one, allow them time to see you, then quickly hide behind a crate or go back out into the previous room, or run into another room, turn around, and WAIT for them to run to you.  They will most likely come to you, and this is the very best time to take them out.  This is a trick I learned in Medal of Honor and I'm happy to find it also works in many situations here in Quake II. So let's see.  The framerate is identical to Medal of Honor, in addition to the controls.  How about the graphics?  Quake II has pretty good, colorful graphics (which is surprising because most Playstation games are dark, not to mention the PC version mostly features dark and ugly hallways and rooms).  The animations from enemies dying isn't exactly the best you've ever seen, but please keep in mind that Quake II is supposed to be a nonstop shooting blood-bath of a game, and of course, compared to the PC version of the same game of COURSE everything on the PC version will look and play a little better.  You're supposed to be amazed that the Playstation can even HANDLE such an excellent game so well with only minor problems.  Extremely minor problems, at that. The thing that REALLY amazes me about the Playstation version of Quake II is that, when you go around corners or run down a hallway, the graphics on the ceiling, floor or side of a wall NEVER turn choppy or glitchy.  NEVER.  I'm serious.  We're talking about an old Playstation game here where the framerate and graphics consistently hold up and remain silky smooth, like homemade caramel.  Everything remains firmly intact.  This is truly amazing.  Excellent job and a HUGE thank you to all the people who created this game.  They understood that controlling a game and not having the graphics fall apart while running around shooting is the most important aspect of a game.  Not just first-person shooters either- ANY kind of game. Okay, sometimes the game might slow down when too many enemies are on the screen at once.  Big deal.  Slow down has always been an overrated problem among most people who complain about it, in my opinion.  Just because a game occasionally slows down a *little* bit shouldn't be a reason to put a game down, EVER. Another thing people criticize about games... loading times.  The loading times in Quake II are extremely short.  Well, not always.  Let me explain.  You have to go through a bunch of mini levels in order to complete a mission entirely.  Sometimes while walking from door to door inside one of the mini levels, the game will take, and I promise I'm not exaggerating, TWO SECONDS to load the next room.  Yes, that's right.  Two whole seconds.  It's not a big deal at all. However, when each of the mini levels are complete, a save option will appear on screen.  The loading time here will jump up to about 5 seconds total.  Again, not a big deal.  Not a long wait at all.  I can't believe I have to mention these extremely short loading times, but people seem obsessed over making a big deal over them, and the truth about it needs to be said.  These are reasonable and understandable loading times when you consider just how GOOD everything about the Playstation version of Quake II is. The music in the game is a bunch of Van Halen-like heavy metal songs, with maybe a touch of crunchy Megadeth riffs thrown in for good measure.  If this kind of music bothers you, prepare yourself, because the entire game is dominated with this kind of music.  It's a little heavier than you might think.  Get ready.  However, some of the music is starting to grow on me. As far as difficulty goes, it's pretty hard.  Mission One is easy enough with health packs sitting everywhere, but as soon as Mission Two begins, the difficulty really jumps up.  Even on Easy Mode.  Of course, the higher difficulty options will greatly increase the challenge, but I think I'm nice and comfortable sticking around on the easiest setting the game has available.  A trick to making the game easier is to frequently aim for the heads of enemies.  Not their feet or stomach- their heads. In conclusion- if you own a Playstation One console and want a good first-person shooter, you can't go wrong with this fantastic version.  In some areas, such as graphical colors and the appropriate buttons used on the Playstation controller, it might even put the PC version to shame.</td><td>a solid and entertaining version</td><td>1174003200</td><td>1</td><td>1344</td><td>5850</td><td>82</td><td>4.352678571428571</td><td>16.390243902439025</td><td>0.11731087</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>5022</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>01 28, 2016</td><td>B00001QER9</td><td>Ryan Sil. (Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>I've always enjoyed licensed video games that were created by Traveler's Tales; they usually do a good job of capturing the essence of the source material the game represents and provide solid gameplay on top of it. This is of course proven with their lineup of Lego installments that still continue to this day, but if I have to pick a favorite of all that they've done, it would have to be none other than Toy Story 2! This one goes quite a few steps beyond the call of duty to truly breathe that Disney magic! Just the fact that you get to play as the \"World's Greatest Superhero\", Buzz Lightyear, is enough to attract my attention! But this isn't just a game with Buzz being the star of the show; this is an all-out 3D action-adventure-platformer that actually manages to give me severe Banjo Kazooie vibes due to how you could find certain characters or hints that would establish a mission for you. Appropriately enough, the levels in this game are HUGE in comparison to what I would see in games such as Super Mario 64! Yet, fascinatingly, every area in the game has specific set pieces and is unique from one another so it actually isn't at all easy to get lost! At the same time, the game proudly encourages exploration, and it makes sure the player has plenty to do and see. Speaking of seeing, the presentation is absolutely something to behold! Admittedly, graphics such as character textures have shown their age and can only be seen as crude at this point, but everything is decidedly colorful and detailed, and some of the levels are coupled with some of the catchiest video game musics I've ever had the pleasure of listening to (Okay, maybe that's a bit of a bold claim, but...It's just amazing)! And when all is done in a level (unless you backtrack to do a mission you didn't complete), moving on to the next level rewards you with a FMV clip straight from the Toy Story 2 film (although with a few vocal differences in certain clips, I notice). It's always a treat to watch these scenes. If there's anything I have to complain about this game, they are really just nitpicks. For example, the concept of Buzz Lightyear shooting around despite being a toy is awesome, but Buzz himself seems to keep contradicting his developed persona in the film; he every now and then spouts a sound clip from the first Toy Story, back when Buzz was delusional and thought he was a space ranger. It can also be a bit bothersome falling from a great height when trying to reach an area involved with the mission you would want to accomplish. But honestly...I just can't pinpoint anything major against this game, because the game seriously enthralled me from start to finish! The big and robust level design, superb soundtrack, detailed and colorful graphics, movie FMVs...It all makes for one great action-packed Banjo-style collect-a-thon, and I LOVE IT!! I'm so glad I finally pulled this out of my backlog, and I highly recommend Toy Story 2 to any gamer looking for a title of its kind!</td><td>To infinity.......AND BEYOND!!!</td><td>1453939200</td><td>0</td><td>533</td><td>2459</td><td>18</td><td>4.613508442776736</td><td>29.61111111111111</td><td>0.19292644</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E</td><td>5107</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>03 29, 2012</td><td>B00001OWYW</td><td>Richard Baker</td><td>The Good: Fast fun gameplay, nice graphical style, some of the best video game music ever created, long, good story The Bad: Extreme difficulty can really turn some people away, the age here shows quite a bit I never played this game before until now.

But I always think of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  By far this is the greatest 2D platformer to ever grace the gaming world, and there is no Castlevania better than Symphony of the Night. The game begins in 1792 with Richter Belmont going into battle with Dracula.  After Richter emerges victorious and banishes Dracula, the mysterious Castle disappears.  But a year afterwards Richter suddenly vanishes.  Maria, a close friend of his sets out to find him and out of nowhere Castlevania, the home of Dracula appears out of nowhere. You play as Alucard, the son of Dracula, who rushes into Castlevania when it appears in order to destroy it and prevent Dracula from returning. It's a very simple story, but its an action/adventure game.  The game also throws in some RPG elements.  Unlike the past Castlevania games, you're character now levels up and can equip weapons and armor.  Alucard also doesn't use the trademark whip like the Belmont's used to.  You actually use a Sword in one hand and you can even have a different weapon in another.  The game also presents a Super Metroid style map that you will use as you explore the castle looking for bosses to defeat and finding all of your abilities to take on Dracula. Like the classic games you've got \"Sub-weapons\" that use hearts.  Each weapon has its advantages and disadvantages.  For example, the throwing knives can be used for long range attacks but are fairly weak.  The Holy Cross does TONS of damage but cost a lot of hearts. You also have \"relics\" that you either find lying around or get from defeating bosses.  These relics help Alucard out and enhance his abilities.  You can use some relics to help you turn into a Wolf, turn into a bat or a cloud of mist. There is also a relic that lets you summon an ally known as a \"Familiar\" by your side. You can also use spells to hinder your skills.  The spells are done with a D-Pad combination. The visual look and feel of this game is astonishing.  A 2D game has never looked this good.  Even so many years later the graphics look really good.  Some are a tad bit fuzzy but you'll quickly get over that. The music is perhaps the best part about Castlevania: SOTN.  The tunes are addicting and you'll be humming them for a while.  The tunes were so good that I found myself just... standing around in one area just so I could enjoy the music. The game also throws in a twist halfway through.  Once you're done exploring the first castle you'll go to a \"Reverse\" castle in which everything is upside down.  The game also has four different endings. This is perhaps the best Playstation game of all time.  It is the best Castlevania hands down (with the excellent Circle of the Moon coming in second) and is the most breathtaking in the series.</td><td>This must be what heaven feels like!</td><td>1094256000</td><td>1</td><td>539</td><td>2352</td><td>40</td><td>4.363636363636363</td><td>13.475</td><td>0.17086168</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>5149</td><td>1.0</td><td>17</td><td>false</td><td>02 9, 2004</td><td>B00001OWYW</td><td>Bryan</td><td>It doesn't make any sense.  How can this game be considered a classic?  It has WAY too many flaws for people to continue naming it \"best game of all-time\" or \"best Castlevania game you'll ever play\". I don't think so.  If you want a \"real\" Castlevania game, go play Castlevania 64 for the N64.  That's how a Castlevania game should be done.  Not like Symphony Of The Night, which is basically a complete disaster with its many inexplicable problems. Don't believe me?  You will soon enough.  First and foremost, Konami must think all Castlevania fans are forgetful and dumb.  You see, the game begins with you playing as Richter, and you're back in the final stage of the previous Castlevania game fighting Dracula.  This is ridiculous.  I don't want to play THAT game, I want to play Symphony Of The Night.  You don't have to redo the final fight with Wart in the beginning of Super Mario Bros. 3.  So you shouldn't have to start off Symphony Of The Night by going back and fighting the final boss in the previous game.  What the hell is wrong with Konami?  This whole Richter/Dracula thing should have been removed. After that's over, the REAL game begins, but unfortunately that's not true.  It doesn't begin yet.  Immediately a screen is shown of Alucard running to the castle (which you unfortunately have no control over).  Once he's inside and the gate closes, you can now play as him, but wait a minute.  There's no music playing in the background.  A game can't really start if there's no music, because the absence of music makes a game feel empty and unexciting. Luckily, my worst fear didn't come true (that Konami forgot to put music in the game) and you just have to move forward a few steps and battle a few more foes before the music kicks in.  It's about time!  You had me worried there! But then more problems arise.  In the same little area where the music kicks in, you encounter these zombies that come out of the ground and walk towards you, and many times you never see these zombies coming until it's too late and you take a hit.  Pesky little things like this are just one of many reasons this game is almost completely unbearable. Eventually you meet up with a young lady named Maria.  She's extremely attractive, and knows just how to push the right flirting buttons.  And that's a big problem.  The way she seems to come on to Alucard and practically drool all over him is such a turn-on to the player that it's very difficult to move forward and continue on with the quest.  After a Maria encounter, you can't stop thinking about her beautiful pale face, those big beautiful eyes, that smooth relaxing voice, and so then what happens after that is, when you are in the middle of a serious battle, you almost always die because you can't stop thinking about Maria's beautiful face. Konami must not understand that mostly boys play video games.  I shouldn't have to say it, but I think it's obvious that the creators of Maria are disappointed in themselves for creating such a good-looking woman, because one look at Maria distracts boys everywhere.  They shouldn't have made her look so pretty.  Because of this, only the strongest male gamers will be able to complete this Castlevania adventure.  Had she been less attractive, guys would be able to better concentrate on the game. You're probably thinking by now \"Alright, talk about the actual GAME!\"  Okay, I will, but you won't like what I have to say.  It's just really painful for me to pick out all the problems in this supposed classic.  Basically, it all boils down to one thing.  The fact that some weapons in this game are incredibly slow, weak and almost useless.  Yes, I'm talking about the Jewel Sword and the Sword Of Hador.  Konami never should have put these two weapons in the game.  But because they did, we have no choice but to put up with them, and I have no choice but to complain.  These two weapons really drag the game down. I could go on and on about the many problems you will see in this game.  Twice in the game you will have to fight a guy who looks exactly like you, which if you ask me, lacks creativity.  Konami wasted a good opportunity right there to come up with new and exciting bosses to fight, but no, they had to go with the old predictable mirror match. Many enemies have blood fiercely squirting out of their bodies when you attack them, forcing me and my children to look away from the TV screen.  Because me and my children understand that if we look at the screen and see this violence, we will throw up all over ourselves and even worse, we might even have trouble making it through the day without screaming in fear that the same brutal treatment might happen to us if we're not careful.  A little bit of blood is fine, but some of the blood in Symphony Of The Night is a bit too graphic and plentiful.  It's enough to terrorize you.  So the best thing to do would be to try and jump over these bloody enemies so you won't have to attack them, though in many places, avoiding enemies won't be easy. Finally, the biggest problem.  The second castle in the game is just the first castle turned upside down, so it's not really a new castle.  Now that's what I call clumsy.  Between the smutty actions of Maria and the blood all over the place, it feels like I'm watching a porno blood fest.  Not a pretty thought, is it?  So as you can see, many problems prevent this game from being a classic.  Don't even think about buying it.</td><td>Konami never should have made this game</td><td>1076284800</td><td>1</td><td>1037</td><td>4414</td><td>58</td><td>4.256509161041466</td><td>17.879310344827587</td><td>-0.013351788</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>5206</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 4, 2000</td><td>B00001SHON</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Strategy games are often games that require you slice your enemy into  bits, blow up his tanks, and mow down his peasants. It's so wonderful to  find a fantastic strategy game that is at its root a monetary war, instead  of a physical one. In Railroad Tycoon II you being with the famous  B&O Railroad, connecting cities in the northeast corridor of the US.  You begin with single track, determining which city needs which goods, and  how to give each city what they want while managing your finances. As you  get more money you can build larger stations, buy bigger engines, beef up  your track system, and more. Cities will offer you money in exchange for  building track out to them, and the more cities you connect, the more types  of goods you have to offer to other stations on the line. As you move on in  the game you can move on to different areas, even building a network of  rails across Europe. You get annual reports with your finances, can  purchase stock in your own company or from competitors. You can buy farms  and factories, invest, take out loans, but if you wish, you can simply ride  the rails and move goods. The graphics are great for a game from '98.  They are done in an organic, old style, with old videos showing events of  the times. You can build telegraph poles to speed station turnaround, hear  about recessions and regrowth of economies, issue bonds, attempt mergers.  The political climate even affects where rights are cheap or expensive to  buy. It's a lesson in history as well as a challenging mental  exercise! Some of the more advanced features are a bit difficult to  figure out, but there are numerous web sites out there that will quickly  guide you through those situations. For most of the game, it's incredibly  easy to learn, and the status screens tell you at a glance what is going  on. You can even customize your own map, and play in another country or  in a mythical situation of your own devising. I recommend this highly as  a great strategy game for all ages that you actually come away with knowing  more than you did when you began.</td><td>Proves strategy doesn't always involve bloodshed</td><td>968025600</td><td>0</td><td>401</td><td>1689</td><td>18</td><td>4.211970074812967</td><td>22.27777777777778</td><td>0.1851142</td><td>862</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>5433</td><td>5.0</td><td>9</td><td>false</td><td>04 22, 2006</td><td>B00001XDUB</td><td>Bryan</td><td>What a perfect day to review a dreary, scary classic video game.  This is one of those rainy, cold and windy April days.  We have them every year. After being teased with exceptionally warm weather a couple days ago, days like today make you realize how lucky you are to experience warmer than normal temperatures.  I could sit here and talk about the weather all day (and I probably will after this review is finished) but it's time to review a game that was groundbreaking at the time of its release.  A game that was VERY disturbing then, and just as disturbing today. For those of you older gamers who've been playing games way before Silent Hill was released, I bet you've played games that had their share of creepy moments- a certain memorable level in a video game that you've always felt uncomfortable exploring because you just didn't think you'd be able to calm your nerves when you arrive to that area of the game.  Come on now, you can tell me it's \"just a video game\" but when everyone leaves your bedroom, and it's just YOU in front of your TV screen playing a video game late at night, you're bound to come across SOMETHING in SOME game that will frighten you.  Now imagine if an ENTIRE game featured TOTAL nonstop adrenaline-pumping fear.  A game that strikes fear inside of you like no other.  We're talking about a game that forces you to think about death, and really frightens that little part inside of your head that you thought had been permanently laid to rest once you entered your teenage years.  This game brings back every childhood fear and then adds some more. This is truly a game for the strong-gutted.  It's true that the level of fear in this game is so high that you will constantly be looking over your shoulder whenever you begin to feel frightened- you will be looking down the hallway of your home and looking out the window to make sure nothing is there.  You want to make sure all those noises you are hearing are coming from the game and not under your bed or somewhere else in your home.  I never thought it was possible to create fear in such a way and pull it off successfully in a video game, but that's what Silent Hill is all about.  Believe it or not, I really think this game is scarier than any movie I've ever watched, and that includes classics like the Exorcist and the Ring.  That's because, in the world of video games, you can picture yourself as the main character (Harry) and picture what it must be like for him to visit a town like Silent Hill and the amount of fear that must be going through both you and Harry. You see, because you, the gamer, are controlling Harry, it's not just Harry going through the dreaded town of Silent Hill by himself, it's YOU and Harry. You two have to stick together and make it out alive.  Both of you have to put those scary feelings aside and progress through the game. There's a little something that makes this game even scarier- the sound of hearing an enemy coming closer to you but not being able to find it. Many times it will be too late and the enemy will have found you first, and you'll take an unexpected blow.  That's not to say the game is a frustrating experience with enemies coming out of nowhere cheap-shotting you, but occasionally it will happen, and this makes the game a LOT of fun. It makes the atmosphere so real and intense you can almost taste it.  If you like entering the world of survival horror and thriller movies, this is the game for you. Just picture this- you're walking down a street in an empty town.  It's snowing, and it's quiet all around you.  Suddenly you hear wings flapping far off in the distance.  You stop dead in your tracks.  The sound becomes louder and louder as *something* gets closer and closer to you. You quickly check all around you to try and see if you can find where that sound is coming from, but you don't see anything.  A scream is heard from far away, a demon-like scream, and then another louder scream soon follows.  Before you know it, you see giant flapping wings right above you, attacking your head.  Your instinct is to defend yourself, but when you turn and aim the gun, the enemy is nowhere to be seen.  You continue to hear flapping sounds and prepare yourself for another round with the beast.  But the sounds get softer and softer until they disappear.  You ask yourself \"is it gone, is it over???\" while continuing to hold your gun in the air.  Sometimes during these moments the enemy WILL be gone, other times it will trick you into thinking it's gone but then come back for another fight.  And this is just in the DAYTIME part of the game!  Imagine how much harder and more frightening this battle becomes when the sky suddenly turns dark and the enemies want to come out and play.  That's what makes the game so great- you just don't know what to expect. Or how about when you arrive to the hospital?  You enter a hospital and no one is around.  Once again, everything is quiet.  It's not so scary, but it's definitely eerie, and it makes you cautious.  You think about what might be ahead of you.  You don't want to explore this hospital but you HAVE to if you want to finish the game.  You look outside the hospital window to see snow still falling to the ground, just as it was before you entered the hospital.  Not so scary, but MAYBE I would feel better if I could find someone.  This hospital is just a LITTLE too empty for me! You explore all the rooms, find some clues, and arrive to an elevator.  You click to go to the third floor but the door is locked, so you have to go back.  You try the second floor and once again, you can't go through the door so you have to go back to the elevator.  You think to yourself \"okay, this is just strange\".  Back inside the elevator, for some unexplainable reason, a 4th floor suddenly becomes an option, so you go there.  You ask yourself \"was that 4th floor ALWAYS there?\"  This time, when you come out of the elevator the door isn't locked, and you're allowed to enter the floor.  Once you enter that floor you WISH that calm, snowy daytime scenery from a few moments ago was still around because now you're in a dark haunted hospital surrounded by nurses with knives constantly slashing at you, floors that have been turned into gates and dreary walls soaked in blood all over every room in the hospital, and the music that plays here is simply amazing the way it makes you think about blood just waiting to ooze from all over the place.  It scares you so much you just want to throw up, and there's no avoiding it- you can't turn back now.  It's a total nightmare! I know the Playstation's old graphics look dated by todays standards and many people have a problem with them, but this game is an exception because the grainy graphics really add more fear and excitement to the game.  It makes it so, no matter where you go, you're surrounded by this world of dreariness.  The level of fear doesn't let up at ALL throughout the entire game- you are forced to either get used to it or else turn off the game if you can't handle it.  I honestly believe there's nothing to be ashamed of if you can't handle it.  Many people can't watch horror movies because after the movie is over and they turn the television off, they're afraid of the silence.  Every little sound they hear after the movie is over will make them jump and yell \"what was THAT!!\" Silent Hill features a variety of fears- you have the \"boogeyman in the closet/sleeping with the light on\" type of fear, and the other major and more dangerous \"please don't make me think about death because I don't know what happens when I die\" type of fear.  It's important to realize, no matter how frightened you may be, in the end you're only playing a video game.  I don't want anyone to go crazy letting the amount of fear in Silent Hill get the best of them, and walk around all day light-headed and nervous.  It's just a game (and you may think I'm exaggerating, but I'm honestly not- it's very well possible Silent Hill could bother you days after you play it). But you have to give a lot of credit to all the people that brought this game to the Playstation- they set out to make the ultimate psychological horror experience, and they succeeded.  It was groundbreaking at the time because no other game company at the time dared to attempt to turn up the amount of horror that this game offered.  It was revolutionary in the world of video games.  With all due respect to Capcom and the Resident Evil series... those games are fantastic and a lot of fun, but Silent Hill made the amount of fear so high that many gamers are afraid to not only play it, but even THINK about it. I think the one thing that makes the experience so overwhelming is the music.  In the final level of the game you will come across some atmospheric parts that sound exactly like an evil wind blowing right by you (and I mean YOU, not Harry Mason).  That's an incredible sound right there.  I'm not someone who usually exaggerates but the creators of this game may have surprised themselves with this constant flow of creepiness! Silent Hill also offers plenty of other things.  A good (but confusing) story, plenty of enemies to shoot with your three guns (or smash with your hammers and swords) and fantastic attention to detail in every area of the game.  Truly deserving of 5 stars.</td><td>Enter Silent Hill if you dare</td><td>1145664000</td><td>1</td><td>1778</td><td>7566</td><td>79</td><td>4.255343082114735</td><td>22.50632911392405</td><td>-0.019630851</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>5511</td><td>4.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>07 7, 2008</td><td>B00001YVBL</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>In 1998, Hideo Kojima single handedly changed the scope of gaming with one game: Metal Gear Solid.  Within Metal Gear Solid, there were ten VR Missions.  Surprisingly, people spent a lot of time with these VR missions, trying to clear them as fast as possible and honing their skills.  When word of this got out, Konami developed Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions.  A game that consisted of nothing but VR missions for the gamers that wanted them. If anyone expected any story out of VR Missions, you'd probably wonder what they were thinking, because VR Missions doesn't have a story.  The game is exactly what it says it is: VR Missions.  Metal Gear Solid VR Missions consist of over 150 missions.  At first you can only do very basic missions, including the same ten that were included in Metal Gear Solid.  As well as training with weapons.  The more missions you complete, the more that will open up, including missions that can get into the bizarre, like fighting a giant soldier and super soldiers. In terms of variety, Metal Gear Solid VR Missions does a great job.  There are so many different varied missions here to keep you busy.  You'll also be able to unlock the Ninja and a couple of other secrets, although, none of these things is very lucrative.  While it's great to play as the Ninja, the controls are a little sloppy, and there are only three incredibly short missions.  As I said, however, there are a ton of VR Missions here to keep you busy for a long time. Visually, VR Missions is on par with the original Metal Gear Solid, the only real problem being that they didn't opt to create more different looking levels.  So much of the stages look fairly generic, save for a few missions where you'll find yourself in some familiar looking areas from Metal Gear Solid.  You can only stare at virtual space for so long.  Much of the music sounds very good though.  While the soundtrack isn't exactly huge, it plays a good part in letting the player know that through and through this is not an action game.  It is definitely a puzzle game. There are two things about Metal Gear Solid VR Missions that can cause some alarm, though.  The first being that many missions are fairly short, meaning that this game only really serves as an expansion of Metal Gear Solid.  It's a mystery why Konami didn't just start packing it in with the original game after a while.  It never really happened.  The second huge problem is that the game advertises that it has 300 missions.  What they don't mention is that many of those missions are the same.  You'll undergo one mission and then be expected to do it again in a Time Attack.  To the developers this serves as two different missions, but it's the same mission.  The only difference is that you'll be doing it with an additional challenge. As a puzzle game, Metal Gear Solid VR Missions is fantastic.  It gets repetitive having to do some of the same missions over and over, and it may only really just be an expansion of one of the bonuses in Metal Gear Solid, but it still serves as a fantastic game for those who crave to do more VR Missions.</td><td>VR Training</td><td>1215388800</td><td>1</td><td>584</td><td>2516</td><td>34</td><td>4.308219178082192</td><td>17.176470588235293</td><td>0.085385084</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>5618</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>07 28, 2006</td><td>B00001X50M</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Updated review- March 20, 2007 I was completely wrong about Metal Gear Solid.  I've really grown to change my mind about the negative thoughts I once had and NOW I think Metal Gear Solid deserves 5 stars (4.5 to be exact).  I especially grew to appreciate the main purpose of the game which is, as many have already mentioned, being encouraged to AVOID the guards that appear on your radar.  The idea of the game is to find ways to avoid enemies- not just go in and attempt to either shoot or break their necks.  No wonder I originally gave the game a low rating.  I went in expecting to kill everything that walked in my way!  The gameplay is a radically different approach from anything I've ever experienced before. I originally said Metal Gear Solid was one of those games I respect more than I enjoy. I said this because so much thought and energy went into the storyline and voice acting, that I felt the game deserved to be respected, and Konami deserved credit for making it. However, playing the game today for the first time in months, I don't know what happened. When I hit the triangle button to put myself in first-person mode, and looked across the hallway to see if a guard happened to be standing there (or walking towards me) I got caught up in the excitement and the quiet atmosphere of trying to find a way around him. It was addicting. I finally figured out how to break their necks and that was a lot of fun, too. The boss fights are actually the very best thing about Metal Gear Solid.  Every single one of them is fun, not to mention they all require you to figure out the best way to defeat them using your rather large selection of guns and figuring out which gun is the correct one. I love fighting that ninja without using weapons and hearing him speak between the action segments.  Hearing enemies talk while you're fighting them makes you want to kick their butts even MORE! I also love when everything is nice and quiet, and then you accidentally walk right by a guard.  When this happens, a loud sound effect comes in that gives off a feeling of \"Oops, my bad!\" because now the guard is chasing you around.  You now have to run for your life.  I didn't realize last year that this is actually a lot of fun. This IS a really good game. I'm sorry for saying it was average last year. Sometimes I need to actually PLAY a game before speaking my mind. Metal Gear Solid is the revolutionary Playstation game that showed the world a new, life-like way to play video games in the late 90's.  The influence this game had on the future of video gaming is simply astounding.  Metal Gear Solid showed how you can take stealth fighting and wrap a gigantic, memorable story around it.  While I'm not a big fan of lengthy twists and turns in video game storylines, I will give Konami a lot of respect for putting an *incredible* amount of time and effort into the game, and in the process, having the Metal Gear Solid series continue to do well on the Playstation 2, and soon, Playstation 3. I especially like the quiet atmosphere while you try finding ways to walk around guards.  It comes off like you're watching a movie instead of playing a video game, or, to put it another way, you're \"playing\" a movie.  Not many people can create an atmosphere quite like this.  Good job Konami. Sometimes the guards aren't as intelligent as you'd like them to be (you can actually walk into an elevator and they will walk right by, without noticing you) and apparently none of them can see you if you're standing only a couple feet away, but you know, these problems are actually pretty nice because it allows gamers to finish Metal Gear Solid without any major difficulty problems.  I can only imagine how hard the game would be if guards were extremely observant all the time. I still have a problem with the overall darkness of the game, though.  More often than not, an important health or ammo pack is located in a hidden dark area, like near a corner, behind a crate or somewhere you can't see.  It's really not a big deal, though.  Just remind yourself to always check every dark area you come across.  If you're still having trouble finding items, just press the triangle button to put yourself in first-person mode, and hit the left or right buttons on the directional pad to scan around.  This works really well.  In fact, the whole first-person camera angle was a great idea from Konami. Even though 20 minutes of cutscenes and conversations isn't really my thing, at least you are given the option to skip through them if you want (by pressing any one of the four main buttons, plus the Start button).  I hate when game companies FORCE you to watch them.  I don't think the storyline is bad in any shape or form.  It's actually decent.  You see, my whole life I've had a belief that a video game should be more about actually \"playing a game\" and less time should be devoted to storyline segments (I'll make an exception for RPGs).  The storyline in Metal Gear Solid is so big and lengthy that if you were to sit there and listen to the whole thing you would be sitting there for HOURS.  Honestly, Metal Gear Solid focuses more on storyline than actual gameplay. With changing times and technology, people began to prefer the realistic aspects of video gaming.  Metal Gear Solid will go down as one of the originators. I DO have one complaint- there doesn't seem to be an option for you to lock-on to your target, so YOU are forced to find and face the target.  For example, if a guard is located south/east of you, you have to actually use the directional pad to face south/east and THEN you can shoot him.  You have to face him directly or he'll continue shooting at you until you're dead.  This can be a pain because turning correctly is a bit of a challenge.  This could have been fixed with one simple \"lock-on nearest target\" feature. Sure, you have guns that can zoom in on a target, but to use THESE guns you have to get into a special position (which changes the angle of the camera).  By the time you get into that position the guard will have already killed you because it takes a few seconds to get into that position, and believe me, you don't have a SECOND to waste once a guard spots you.  I want a gun that features a QUICK lock-on target (such as a gun with high amounts of firepower and frequently-available ammo packs).  That way it won't feel hopeless when a million guards are after me. Besides a bit of overall darkness, a lengthy storyline and sometimes unfair situations regarding aiming and shooting, I have no other problems with the game.  These are really minor problems and it's easy for me to look past them.  A game that I SHOULD have given more attention to before attempting to give a final verdict.  Metal Gear Solid is a classic game.  It just took me a while to see that.</td><td>I was WRONG about this game</td><td>1154044800</td><td>0</td><td>1288</td><td>5539</td><td>64</td><td>4.300465838509317</td><td>20.125</td><td>0.04498678</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>5738</td><td>5.0</td><td>37</td><td>false</td><td>09 18, 2000</td><td>B00001ZWP8</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Not all strategy games are blood and gore, unsuitable for youngsters.

No one knew what was going to happen to the series, and a lot of fans lost hope thinking the silky smooth controls, and excellent digitized graphics would go by the wayside in 3D. However, the game featured excellent visuals (for the time) and the silky smooth controls stayed despite some slippery and awkward animations. The fourth game also introduced some new characters who I thought were some of the weakest in the series. So despite the weaker roster we got some pretty good Fatalities, and excellent stages to fight in. The new characters like Kai, Jarek, Fujin (a weak attempt at making another Raiden), and Tanya were pretty \"bleh\". They didn't have that impact that the classic characters did, but some returned like Scorpion and Sub-Zero, Sonya, and Johnny Cage came back for the first time since MK2. The run button and combos were carried over into 3D which were smooth as well as a first stab at moving in a 3D environment. You would hit a button to kind of strafe to the side to avoid attacks and this added a whole new level of strategy. Weapons were introduced in free form now and every character had one. Get hit though and you lose the weapon until you can pick it back up. The fatalities were extremely brutal and some of the best the series has seen and looked even better in 3D. This leads to a new level of detail and creativity that can't be done in 2D. This was also the slow departure from other \"-alities\" and the series stuck with just Fatalities. A new boss was introduced as Shinnok and Goro returned as the mini-boss. The game carries over a lot of elements that make it still feel classic, but then injects some new stuff as well. I really felt the game was well balanced and was exactly what the first MK in 3D should be. Overall MK4 is a classic and did an amazing job of transferring over into 3D which was very difficult. This of course paved a path for all future MK games, but we can always look back on MK4 as the child.</td><td>A surprising success in MK's first step into 3D</td><td>1332892800</td><td>0</td><td>409</td><td>1836</td><td>20</td><td>4.488997555012225</td><td>20.45</td><td>0.0935285</td><td>471</td></tr><tr><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>5812</td><td>5.0</td><td>11</td><td>false</td><td>07 9, 2002</td><td>B000021Y5S</td><td>N.

MKT does just this, so for people only familiar with the 3D era this is what Armageddon was based off of. Every MK character up to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is in here, plus all the mechanics from UMK3 that everyone loved. The game introduces a new Aggressor meter which is the predecessor of the power meter in the new MK. Getting attacked will increase it (which is just text at the bottom that fills up which I really hate) and then you do extra damage while in Aggressor mode. The combo system is still intact as well as the weapons from UMK3. The 2D games were silky smooth and the graphics look great in Trilogy. Every level as well as a lot of fan favorite music is in the game (you can pull the soundtrack right off the disc.) Using the run button, pulling off a 5 hit combo, and then blocking, jumping around, and using all the signature moves brings back a great feeling of nostalgia. There are some secrets hidden in here such as a special code screen (1 button Fatalities are awesome), plus some original outfits like Raiden, and Kano's original outfit which also unlocks their original Fatality. Of course the game is best played with two people, but single player is also a lot of fun. There are a few minor problems like Shang Tsung's morphs require loading, load times between menu and fights, plus the game will freeze some times which is no good. I also wish maybe Test your Might would have come back, but this really just feels like Mortal Kombat: The Greatest Hits. I also hate how cheap the computer can be on even normal difficulties, plus Shao Kahn is one of the cheapest bosses in gaming history so good luck beating him.

Even before the Playstation Mortal Kombat was known as a groundbreaking game for its graphic violence on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. It was the first of its kind, or one of the first. Looking back at the old 2D fighter games, despite the heavy amount of blood and all the creative fatalities, Mortal Kombat STINKS, plain and simple. The game tries to look dangerous and back in the day it really WAS a threat. Parents were terrified that their children might experience all the blood and gore. We're talking nearly 14 years since the original Mortal Kombats release, and now we can look at the Mortal Kombat series for what it really is: a cheesy-looking and crappy series of uninteresting tournament fighting. That's what the entire series is (until the game turned 3D, then I don't know WHAT to think). Just the way the two fighters attack each other is SO boring. Even the best fighters like Sub-Zero and Noob Saibot are a total bore. Midway thought they really had something going when they created Mortal Kombat Trilogy. It featured nearly EVERYBODY from the previous Mortal Kombat games. How can it be bad? Well, besides the reasons I mention above, the Playstation version is murdered with INCREDIBLE amounts of loading times. People can say the Playstation was a bad system when it came to loading all they want, but the fact remains Mortal Kombat Trilogy is quite possibly the most annoying game when it comes to waiting to play the freaking thing. Sometimes you have to wait almost a minute before the game *finally* loads the fight screen. And the fighting is so bad (because the entire Mortal Kombat series up until this point is severely dated and horrible) that the loading times are actually the part I look forward to the most. I'll give the game one extra point for featuring all the fighters in one nifty little package. Besides that.

Nevertheless it was very rare to have a video game to come straight from the shelves, that wasn't from the arcades. That answer came through with the release of Rush 2. The 1998 video game was made exclusively for the Nintendo 64, and not upon any other console. Ironically, the prequel, San Fransisco Rush, was made on both the N64, and the Playstation. The game features many exciting and enduring automobiles through the streets of some of the biggest cities in America, including New York City, Los Angeles, and Hawaii. The game also includes the infamous Alcatraz prison, a hidden course from the previous Rush. Many fans were shocked to know why the game wasn't on any of the other consoles at the time. The sales for the Playstation version of Rush were just awful, and Midway chose to put this only on Nintendo 64.

The PC version misses out on those things, but it does make up for that by having better animations from enemies and bosses.  But the controls aren't as good as the Playstation controller either (sorry, I need a controller for a video game console because that's what I've grown up with).

When Final Fantasy VIII came around in 1999, it had so much to live up to.  So much hype that the bar was set too high, even for Final Fantasy VIII to hit.  Almost ten years later, it's a little easier to look at Final Fantasy VIII with fondness.  In part because that bar it had to reach is no longer there.  The hype has settled.  We can now look at Final Fantasy VIII for what it is.  It's a great game to be sure, but it still has some problems it has to address. Final Fantasy VIII is, first and foremost, a love story.  It takes a moment to get going but when it does (about halfway through) it turns out to be good.  Final Fantasy VIII is about Squall, a young member who attends the Balamb Garden Academy and is about to undertake a field exam for an elite group called SeeD.  When he finally gets in his first mission to help a resistance group lead by a young woman named Rinoa.  The adventure eventually leads to an epic good versus evil battle as Squall and his allies realize a sorceress is plotting world domination.  For the most part the story is good, but even now it's hard not to notice how it skimps on certain things.  Squall is a well developed character, but Final Fantasy VIII does little to develop its other characters.  You come to like Squall and understand his angst, but you'll hardly come to understand the other characters quite as well. Final Fantasy VIII also utilizes the ATB battle system which has been in place since Final Fantasy IV.  The eighth installment in particular tries to differentiate itself from the rest of the series and succeeds.  Very well.  First there's Final Fantasy VIII's junction system.  Rather than having the convential level up system, this game opts instead to have the enemies raise levels with you.  It seems like this will make the game harder, but the junction system serves as a balance.  First, there's drawing spells.  In battle, characters can draw spells from the enemy.  It's a tedious task and often gets boring, but you can use any spell you have to increase your statistics.  But there's more than that.  You can't junction spells to your stats unless you junction Guardian Forces (Final Fantasy VIII's summons) to a character. Junctioning isn't just a gimmick, however.  It's a necessity to getting through the game as your characters stats won't grow fast enough.  Different spells also have a different impact on certain stats.  More powerful spells will do a better job than their weaker counterparts.  You can also junction to increase your defense against status ailments and even increase your elemental defense enough to absorb spells. The Junction system is a great addition but it's overly complex.  The big problem with it, however, is that the game never gives you an incentive to use one character over another aside from their limit breaks, which are very powerful attacks, but only useful if your HP falls into the yellow (or you cast a certain spell).  Battling in Final Fantasy VIII can be fun, but the biggest problem is that it never encourages you to take advantage of it.  You can draw spells, but depleting your stock of spells also depletes the stat its junctioned to.  In short, if you want to keep most of your stats in tip top shape you'll want to refrain from using some of the game's more devastating spells (as they'll be used to junction).  The junction system does work, however, in letting gamers challenge themselves.  You can make the game as hard or as easy as you like. There are also abilities that each GF carries that allow you to learn several abilities.  Some can give you new commands in battle while others can also help increase your stats by a certain amount. There's quite a bit more to Final Fantasy VIII's gameplay.  There's also a card game called Triple Triad you can play.  It's a simple game complete with complex rules.  It's also incredibly addictive.  There are a couple of other mini-games, but where Final Fantasy VIII really succeeds is it's unremarkable number of sidequests (though most of them become locked on the final disc).  There's a ton of optional things to do here. If anything did go against Final Fantasy VIII, it would be some of the things at the core of its gameplay.  As mentioned earlier drawing is downright boring and long.  There's little incentive to use magic and there's not much point to level grinding or any incentive to actually work for abilities either (why bother if enemies will level up with you?).  The biggest problem is actually getting new weapons.  In most RPGs weapons are found or bought in item shops or earned as rewards for defeating certain enemies.  Final Fantasy VIII does away with all that and makes you scrounge for items to make weapons.  At first it seems creative, but getting some of the more lucrative weapons becomes very taxing and repetitive.  You might find yourself getting into several battles just to get one part for a weapon.  It's helped a little by letting you change items and cards into tools, but some can only be obtained by defeating enemies.  Getting new weapons and making characters more powerful should be a bit more fun than this.  Final Fantasy VIII manages to turn it into a chore. Graphically, however, Final Fantasy VIII is a milestone for the Playstation.  While it's environments can be a little grainy, its character models are very beautiful and actually very human like.  The game doesn't look smooth, however, and some of the art design doesn't look as good as other Final Fantasy games past or present.  It's a visual looker, having some incredibly detailed towns and dungeons and even some incredible looking spell effects and limit breaks (as well as some top notch FMV sequences) but it doesn't always set the mood the way previous installments have.  As much as some may not like to hear it: Final Fantasy VII was a greater visual achievement.  Final Fantasy VIII is incredible to look at, but some of its visuals just look a bit sloppier. Musically Final Fantasy VIII sounds good.  It doesn't sound quite as good as Final Fantasy VI or Final Fantasy X, but the tracks that stand out are among the most recognizable in Final Fantasy history.  Much of it has the love story soundtrack going for it.  There's a lot of slow low key musical numbers.  For some gamers this probably won't cut it.  Especially when compared to the more lively and upbeat soundtracks of the other games. Final Fantasy VIII isn't a bad game, but it's one that tries so hard to be different from the rest of the series and tries too hard to be better than its predecessor.  The truth is, when a game gets labeled the greatest of greats, its probably better not to try and out do it, but to focus on what made it great in the first place and continue in that direction.  Final Fantasy VIII is a good game.  A great game, even, but its gameplay issues make quite a dent in the game as a whole.  It's an amazing experience but with these issues, it keeps it from being the best experience it can be.</td><td>A Final Fantasy That Tries Too Hard</td><td>1215648000</td><td>1</td><td>1315</td><td>5764</td><td>76</td><td>4.383269961977186</td><td>17.30263157894737</td><td>0.11317145</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>6453</td><td>5.0</td><td>32</td><td>false</td><td>09 4, 2000</td><td>B0000296O5</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I hate to admit it, but I used to think Final Fantasy was just a  hack-and-slash series. I finally did some research into the series, and was  amazed by what I read about FF8. I went out and bought a copy right away to  see what it had to offer. I was extremely impressed. Usually games offer  something to adults, or to kids, but rarely do they get a combination that  intrigues both. This has a training system that makes you figure out which  kind of fighter you wish to be, what you want to earn points towards, how  you want to talk to people, and which of your friends make the best allies  against a certain situation. In addition, an embedded card game series is  quite complex, almost chess like. Often we were hard pressed to beat some  of their masters, but winning the games brought great advantages going  forward. The combat and movement wasn't arcade like, where you had to hit  the joystick just right in Spot A to hit the enemy in Spot B. It mostly was  figuring out the right combination of healing, attacking, and defensive  spells to cast to keep your party alive while taking out the enemy. There  was little if any blood and gore. The aim of the fights was to outsmart  your enemy, not to hack ribbons of flesh off of it. And did I mention the  cinematics? The dance scene in particular stands out in my mind as  completely amazing. I would restart there on purpose to see the detail they  put into the movements. If you love good animation, you could buy the game  just to go from scene to scene. If you enjoy role playing and graphic  adventure games at all, I'd highly recommend this one. It does truly have  something for everyone.</td><td>Gorgeous graphics, fun strategy/RP combination</td><td>968025600</td><td>1</td><td>326</td><td>1330</td><td>18</td><td>4.079754601226994</td><td>18.11111111111111</td><td>0.20603317</td><td>862</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>6511</td><td>4.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>08 24, 2000</td><td>B0000296ZN</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>When we saw Metal Fatigue become available, I have to admit we weren't  keen on buying it. It looked like a cheezy cross between Mech Warrior and  Command & Conquer. Still, it said strategy, so we decided to give it a  try. We were very disappointed to find, not only was there no manual in  the box, but there wasn't even a CD liner to read. There wasn't any on line  help either while you're playing - you have to have help open in another  window and ALT-TAB between them to get any information. Not very user  friendly. The game itself, though, is actually pretty interesting.  You're part of one of three different factions - each one builds not only  the standard little ground units, but also giant metal robots which you can  customize quite a bit. You decide what kinds of arms and legs and body they  have, then slowly build them while you construct your base around it. You can build yourself a group of these robots, each one different, and  set them out against the enemies. The graphics are really very nice,  although not quite as good as Dark Reign 2, which pushed the envelope on  strategy gaming graphics. The lanscapes are quite intriguing, with  different levels, craters, mountains, shadows, and other features that help  make gameplay varied and interesting. If you're interested in Mech  Warrior or that kind of robot-based game, you'll probably like customizing  your warriors in here, and building your attack force. If you're a raw  strategist, you might want to start with Dark Reign 2 and then get this as  a fun side game to play.</td><td>Good graphics, reasonably fun</td><td>967075200</td><td>1</td><td>293</td><td>1265</td><td>15</td><td>4.3174061433447095</td><td>19.533333333333335</td><td>0.023022836</td><td>862</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>6635</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>05 22, 2011</td><td>B000029706</td><td>Ryan Sil. (Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>The original Rayman is perhaps one of the finest platformers that ever came out. There's a reason why this game has been re-released for some times (Not as much as Rayman 2, but still). That reason is...everything. The game has one of the best soundtracks I've ever listened to in a video game. I can tell there were LOTS of effort put into this masterpiece. You can even put the game into a CD player and it would play the music! Before there was Ly, Lums, Razorbeard, the Rabbids, or even Globox for that matter, there was Rayman, the fairy that created him, and the evil Mr. Dark. This was a platformer that just suddenly improved upon everything people loved about platforming games. It had great gameplay, catchy music (as noted), and amazing graphics that reveal hugely detailed environments. As you start the game, you only start out with the basics: Running and jumping. But that as you progress through, you get newer powers, such as being able to hang on platforms, THROW your FISTS at enemies (Man, that's cool), and >GASP< being able to fly for a short period of time! Sure, later games have these powers as staples to Rayman's character, but back when this was the only game out, you have to work your way to get these....and you would have fun doing it. The problem is that younger gamers may be put off by the game's difficulty. Yeah, it is challenging, but some find it to actually be TOO challenging. Nevertheless, this is a gem that you should buy in case you have a Playstation lying around.</td><td>Spectacular</td><td>1306022400</td><td>0</td><td>271</td><td>1238</td><td>22</td><td>4.568265682656826</td><td>12.318181818181818</td><td>0.12045454</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>6889</td><td>5.0</td><td>18</td><td>false</td><td>06 26, 2000</td><td>B00002EPZ2</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I've role-played since the 70s, and have probably played every RP game that's come out since that date, including recent reviews for BellaOnline.com. My first assumption was that Planescape would be a  knock-off of Baldur's Gate, and be fun but not unique. It is, amazingly,  far more than that. Sure, it's built on the same great engine that  Baldur's Gate was. Same third person view, with the great graphics and  sounds that BG is famous for. However, the developers of Planescape  definitely knew what they were doing when they enhanced the system. They  addressed many complaints gamers had with BG, and took it to another level. Take death. Yes, that pesky death stuff that seems to happen to gamers  when they encounter a group of basilisks or perhaps a bandit or three. No  problem for Planescape - you're immortal! Not only that, but deaths  actually help you sometimes, jarring loose memories that were until that  point hidden. Like who you are. What you're about. Why you're immortal when  apparently nobody else is. Which brings me to another point - the  storyline is great! They take an idea that has definitely been done before  - you wake up with amnesia, uncertain of your past or present. Nine Princes  of Amber is a famous story that does this very well. So you learn as you  go, with the help of your amusing sidekick, the skull named Morte. Yes,  your pal is a floating skull who follows you along :) The game is  understandably \"dark\". You are, after all, someone who keeps  rising from the grave, wandering around a miserable little town full of  unhappy people. It's probably not a game for 6 year olds, but most  teenagers will easily relate to the misery of the town's occupants. You  find things like clot charms to help heal your wounds, bandages to tape  yourself back up. It's the same quests and challenges, but it's so much  more ... Your alignment actually alters as you interact with NPCs. Keep  doing good things - your alignment is naturally good. Keep slaughtering  innocents while they plead for mercy, and yup, you're bad. Your alignment  then affects how people react to you. Even better - your intelligence  determines what you can say or do in some cases!  No more of this idiotic  barbarian easily figuring out how to deal with a noble negotiator. I was  impressed! There are all sorts of twisted plot items that are clear  indicators of the amount of work the designers put into thinking this  through. You wake up with a note to yourself carved in your own back. You  wander outside and find a note-zombie, with notes stuck to his body. Every  doorway can be a portal to another world, if you find the key. But keys can  be anything - a piece of paper, a certain person, even a song sung in a  certain way. The game is definitely a thinking game - one created for  true strategists and role players, who want a challenge out of a game and  not just a hack-fest. For gamers who have complained that RP could never be  fun on a computer, try Planescape Torment.

Atfirst glance, this game seems like a rip-off of many other games outthere. Diablo or Baldur's Gate, anyone? What original ideas. You can be a warrior, conjurer or wizard. You come from Earth, you're sent into another dimension where you are the Only Hope. Even worse, you're a male from a Florida trailer park whose idea of fun is crushing beer cans against his forehead while rebuilding truck engines. Let's talk about the anti-good-gaming ideal. However, when you start up the game, the graphics amaze you. The whole sparkling mouse, the smooth graphics on all the select screens, and then the game play graphics. Simply amazing. Barrels are not just background decoration, they are all discreet individual objects.  Rocks, skulls, you name it - all individual objects that can be moved around. The enemies all have personalities. The three factions all have distinct reasons for existing, and are in conflict with each other. The comments are humorous and the individuals have personality. I suppose at times the coders can overcome even the most inane marketers when it comes to game design. The spells are great!  The conjurer, my favorite character type, has a Pixie Swarm to help defend him, and can have various creatures hang out with him as sort of a roving company of friends. I like the wolves and spiders myself, but you can acquire just about any enemy out there to hang out with you and help protect you. The training levels are easy to get the hang of. I dislike the cone-of-vision, because even if you were just in a room, you suddenly forget where everything is in it - even the walls - and have to visit again to make sure you didn't miss anything. If you swing by a room, it draws it as a complete room, so it's difficult to tell from maps where you have been and where you have just passed by. Also, save games are limited and you can't describe them at all. They simply list the character name and actual time - making it quite difficult for a multi-gamer household like mine to keep characters separated! There are other minor bugs - icons don't consistantly draw in, and multi-player bugs are slightly annoying. The game itself is WAY too short when played in single player mode. Multi-player gets old really quickly, as you run around trying to kill each other over and over again. How about cooperative quests, like in BG? In general though, the graphics and gameplay on this game are quite better than I had expected from a game that touted male-only characters. If only they had put a bit of effort into thinking about the people playing this game, and what they would want to play! I would have rated this game extremely highly, instead of only reasonably high.

Age of Empires II - The Age of Kings stands the test of time. This is a game that is fun even years after its release. You would think a game created in 1999 would seem blocky and old after only a year or two. Quite the contrary. The gameplay, immersion in detail, and strategic fun in Age of Empires II makes it into a game that I envision will be playable and fun for years to come. The game takes you through a variety of situations. You need to be an efficient hunter-gatherer. You have to know how to manage naval warfare. It's a great test of your ability to think outside the box, as you investigate and manage a new set of challenges with every pass. I adore history, so it was a treat to be in a scenario with William Wallace and Joan of Arc. You see the real life locations they had to fight through, and you save the day with your own activities. The locations span the globe, keeping things interesting. I realize that some people aren't interested in multiplayer and certainly there is enough here in the game to keep a solo player happy. However, those who do love multiplayer will be in for a treat. The game does an excellent job of keeping all sides engaged in the battle. I happen to love the multiplayer aspect here. Yes, the graphics aren't super high def and up to current standards. That is quite all right by me. The gameplay itself is well done, and really after a few minutes I don't even notice what the details of the various structures look like. I am too busy racing around the screen planning my defenses. As long as the on screen icons are easy to identify and work with, that's all that matters to me. Are there any downsides? I imagine gamers who are most focused on first person shooters, who want to aim rifles at heads and shoot, probably won't be as keen on the strategy based, long term planning involved here.

More than enough!  Let's talk about the very first one, on the original Playstation.  This game is a fantastic first-person shooter *and* a great World War II game.  You get the best of both worlds with Medal of Honor. I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that when it comes to first-person shooters, I am absolutely *horrible* at them.  Enemies seem to find a way to come out of nowhere ALL the time and cheap-shot me, and then, of course, I die very quickly.  With most games like this, you barely have enough time to react to their insane shooting rampage and learn the controls before it's quickly \"game over\".  With Medal of Honor I can FINALLY put those nightmare problems to rest.  I can actually complete about 50% of this game, which, by my standards, is a BIG pat on the back.  I never would have guessed understanding a game like this was possible (and be able to complete some levels) but it's true!  Here's why: - The buttons are laid out *perfectly* on the Playstation controller.  The target button is really easy to use.  You can use the directional pad to move it around and locate the enemy.  It never fails. The shoot button works great.  The jump and duck buttons work great.  EVERYTHING works great!  When you aim at something before shooting, it actually works.  It's amazing how many games get this wrong and the whole experience is ruined.  The play control is a major improvement compared to Syphon Filter, for example.  In that game, it felt like I was awkwardly walking or sliding all over the place. - The challenge in Medal of Honor is perfect for people who are NOT professionals when it comes to first-person shooters.  The challenge in each level builds and builds, very slowly, allowing you to learn and master the controls while you make progress.  Syphon Filter fails to do this.  So does Metal Gear Solid.  Medal of Honor is an easy-to-understand shooting game for people who normally aren't very good at these kind of games.  I really want to thank DreamWorks (the company responsible for this game) for making the challenge just right. Also, you encounter just a few cutscenes here and there, and each one is very interesting to watch because they show you what it was like during World War II, and you may even learn some stuff about the war that you've never known before.  Good cutscenes. The objectives you have to complete are always pretty fun, and not too difficult (until later in the game).  When I say \"not too difficult\" I mean, not too difficult to understand *and* not too difficult to complete.  Whenever you want to find out what you have to do, just press the Start button and your short and simple objectives will be given to you right there. As a shooting game, Medal of Honor shines and easily surpasses most first-person shooters once again.  Enemies are everywhere, and many of them want you dead immediately.  Luckily, they give you enough time to react.  When you arrive to a harder level later on... well, keep in mind that you will have to keep playing certain levels over and over, and learn where each and every enemy is located, and take them out as quickly and effectively as you can.  Trust me, this is really fun.  It's *so* much fun to find out which gun you're carrying is most effective on the enemy you encounter.  You will probably lose a bunch of times while you learn, but this is all part of the fun.  Making it to the end of a level *doesn't* require luck like in Syphon Filter, and you will feel satisfied once you've completed a stage.  You can even play the completed stages over and over again, if you want.  Medal of Honor is so good, why not play the same stages over a hundred times? I don't know what else to say.  I love this game.  Oh yeah, the music and sound effects!  The music is like listening to a suspenseful, realistic war movie.  It's really good.  The sound effects are awesome as well because each soldier you encounter has something interesting and different to say.  You will be amazed at how many new lines these soliders can come up with!  You will hear the sound of silence while walking around in the dark, along with the sound of distant gunshots and other creepy sounds.  All this adds up to a disturbingly, realistic wartime experience. Oh, and the animations you will see from enemies falling over after they've been shot is *clearly* a notch above the rest.  Even after killing these guys a million times, they seem to find new ways to amaze me with their ability to squirm around and struggle to survive.  Simply put, you will *always* see soldiers do different things before they die. Sometimes they shoot wildly all over the place while falling over and dying.  Other times they will fall to their knees before falling over for good.  Wherever you shoot on their body, they will react very realistically.  Shoot them in the foot they hop around.  These are probably normal and understandable things that a human being would do if they were dying. The weapons are what you'd expect in a wartime game.  Very good weapons, and very easy to aim and use them on an enemy.  No problems here. I haven't encountered any blood in the game yet, but, as far as I'm concerned, blood is overrated because the color red is just that- a color.  It means nothing to the actual gameplay. Some very minor problems I had is that sometimes your main character moves around too quickly, which means sometimes you may accidentally walk right into danger, and the graphics are slightly dark and dated.  Just slightly.  Don't forget the occasional Playstation glitches.  Also, there are actually loading times in the game.  It takes 10-15 seconds to load a stage.  I thought by 1999, loading times were a thing of the past.  Despite these problems, Medal of Honor is still a near-perfect game. Overall, please buy this awesome first-person shooter.  Today, in 2007, first-person shooters and war games (specifically World War II games) are all OVER the place to the point where it's almost boring to play one anymore.  This is because war time games are a genre that has lost its appeal over the years, thanks to overexposure and repeating more or less the same required-strategies with each new game that gets released.  In other words, all war games are basically the same thing these days.  It's boring.  But guess what?  Back in 1999, when Medal of Honor was brand new, the Playstation didn't have a whole lot of games like this, and war games were treated with more respect, which make Medal of Honor all the more special.

The graphics look very shrunken down, with the color just looking odd, and the catchy music of the original seems to be nearly absent, as the first few notes only play as intro music.

The graphics, while terrible, aren't worth complaining about since I grew up in the NES days of the 80's/early 90's and remember very fondly how terrible many graphics were.  No, I can't defend them.  Nobody can.  It's all about whether you grew up back then.  If you did, you can better understand and appreciate the way the game looks. My biggest grip is that the play control is pretty lousy.  Mario seems to float whenever you jump, and the same can be said for many of the items such as the mushrooms that floats once removed from a coin box, and the star as well.  Oh, and the starman music is simply atrocious.  Ignore that completely. The challenge definitely depends on how well you can control Mario's movements because if these controls were top-notch like Super Mario Bros, guess what?  Super Mario Land would be incredibly easy.  This is because a good portion of the game is basically the first Mario game blended with elements of Super Mario Bros. 3.  The only exception is the underwater fireball-spitting machine stage which is a nice shooting adventure type experiment, and the airplane stage which is basically the same thing but in the air. The enemy animations are laughable.  The goombas look just like the mushrooms for crying out loud!  They also resemble ugly skulls, and the koopa troopas are really skinny and malnourished.  The dry fish that pop out of the ground and go directly up are mediocre looking.  Some of the other enemies that are brand new are actually reasonable.  Oh and an enemy that goes by the name of \"Bunbun\" (LOL!) is really nice.  I believe this enemy influenced the Super Mario Bros. 3 flying goombas but I could be wrong.  Actually I'm not sure I'm thinking of the right enemy after all.  Oh well, at least I got to say the hilarious word \"Bunbun!\" I just really hate how the first half of the game feels like a watered down Super Mario Bros. with the pipes and coins feeling like they're lifted directly from SMB.  Not *directly* of course, but close enough that the developers should have put in more effort to make the coins and pipes stand apart from any connection to SMB. I HATE the music.  All of it.  Just really screechy and irritating bloops and bleeps that hardly resemble a melody (except for the castle theme which is some kind of cliched Egyptian music).  There's also a fairly melodic Asian theme later on that, again, is repetitive and cliched, and the game ending music is really spectacular as well.  That's it.  At least on the NES an effort was actually made to make ALL the themes memorable and bearable. On the plus side, I like how Mario shoots fireballs.  The way they bounce and hit enemies on an angle is a nice surprise that takes a small amount of skill to master, and the size of them is quite impressive as well.  Fighting a variety of bosses instead of Bowser is definitely a plus in my book.  Oh, and the challenge is actually pretty high in a few spots such as the bouncing boulders that you have to ride over spikes.  This is pretty hard. Oh, and Daisy?  She's a LOT better than Princess Toadstool.  By now you're probably well aware that the Princess allows Bowser to kidnap her because she's an attention seeker.  Daisy is not only more attractive, but more sensible and respectable, so you really WANT to put in the additional effort to rescue her.  In a perfect world Daisy would have been the one to face an enormous amount of success and Princess Toadstool would have been forgotten.  You see Princess Toadstool is too much of a fake, generic woman who's *supposed* to be attractive like Vanna White.  Daisy is a REAL woman that you want to cuddle and comfort.  There's a BIG difference between the two. Instead of reaching a flag at the end of each stage, you're given a choice between two doors.  The top door takes you to a bonus area where you can get powerups and 1-ups.  Always go for the top door if you can.  This is mainly how you acquire 1-ups. Nah it's not quite a classic but it's a commendable effort.</td><td>good, but hardly great</td><td>1329177600</td><td>0</td><td>786</td><td>3398</td><td>50</td><td>4.323155216284987</td><td>15.72</td><td>0.10047268</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>7297</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>11 24, 2010</td><td>B00002ST28</td><td>Ryan Sil.

It features the great gameplay that hailed from Super Mario Bros, although few physics are a little bit off. The graphics and sounds were greatly-developed, especially the music. SML is one of the few games that prove that even the game with the smallest length can succeed. There's only 12 levels, not counting the harder quest (Yup. This game has a harder quest like in SMB). Also, Mario Land may be fun and all, but who knew it was so strange? There's no Bowser, Peach, or even the Mushroom Kingdom, but instead, you romp through Egypt, chasing an alien named Tatanga who has captured Daisy. And that's just the setting. In-game, there are Koopas with bombs for shells, robots, and when you go to World 4, it turns out that world takes place in Japan, as hinted by the music! The Fire Flower isn't even a Fire Flower. Instead, you get to shoot Superballs, which are rubber version of fireballs that can bounce off walls. Despite all that strangeness, it's pure Mario action in the palm of your hand.</td><td>Mario in your pocket</td><td>1290556800</td><td>0</td><td>198</td><td>898</td><td>12</td><td>4.5353535353535355</td><td>16.5</td><td>-0.01201814</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>7305</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>12 20, 2003</td><td>B00002ST28</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>Alright, I know there are those with the gripes (can't save, only 12 levels, blah blah blah) but this game is pretty old guys.

You can beat the game in simply 30 minutes. There should be no reason why anyone should have to save at all.  It's very easy to rack up several lives thanks to the bonus game that Nintendo threw in as well. For 1989 and for the early years of the Gameboy these graphics aren't bad.  While they look like something seen on a graphing calculator they're not bad considering its age. The game isn't too hard, but it isn't so easy either.  The gameplay is similar to the original Mario Bros. on the NES.  Except that you can't tell which power up you've got.  That could be a problem. The game can be played by just about anyone.

The original's gameplay was a hugely modified from Super Mario Land 2 to replace Mario's block-hitting and Goomba-stomping with enemy bashing, Ground Pounding, and crazy powers that help improve your regular bashing attack. This game may not have those power-ups, nor does it have any evidence of Mario Land 2, but it surely took all of the great original elements of the first Wario Land and made it 5 times better. The graphics look amazing on the old-school Game Boy, and the sound effects/music are just as spot-on. You would think that by then, since the Nintendo 64 and Playstation systems were out (Oh, and Saturn), the monochrome graphics and sounds would be weak by the years' standards, but nope (And the Game Boy Color version has....color!). One unique aspect about Wario Land 2 is that you can't lose/gain lives, so it wouldn't be a frustrating experience for new players. However, there's no need to worry about the difficulty, as the challenge is still there, and going strong enough to be fair for everyone. The level designs have a very interesting variety of platforms and enemies, as well as some neat decorations. The game never seems to grow pretty boring at all. And along with all of the bashing, throwing, pouncing, etc you could do, there are also a few puzzle elements thrown in certain levels /:-) Overall, this is an amazing Game Boy experience, and like all the Nintendo greats out there, it remains timeless to this day.</td><td>Yet another Nintendo classic :-)</td><td>1323302400</td><td>0</td><td>261</td><td>1248</td><td>15</td><td>4.781609195402299</td><td>17.4</td><td>0.13286224</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>7336</td><td>5.0</td><td>9</td><td>false</td><td>11 30, 2002</td><td>B00002ST7U</td><td>N.

Sega's original X-Men game was an exception that captured some of the intensity of the comic and Fox cartoon, and its' sequel X-Men 2: The Clone Wars also excells above most of the other comic licensed games.  You can choose to play as Beast, Cyclops, Gambit, Nightcrawler, Psylocke, and Wolverine, and after defeating Magneto on Asteroid M you get to play as him as well (and he is the best character in the game).  The levels are huge and expansive and include Siberia, Asteroid M, the Amazon jungle, and the Phalanx clone laboritories.  The bosses are tough and range from Apocalypse, Brainchild, Tusk, a Sentinel brain, clones of the X-Men, and the huge rampaging Brood beast that chases after you in the final level.  The characters are nicely animated and are large,  pixelated, and colorful and resemble they're comic counterparts.  The control scheme is simple, and the background music is actually great (and that is saying something considering the Genesis didn't have the best sound chip in the world) and the difficulty will make you come back and play it again and again.  All in all, if you still have your Genesis and are an X-Men fan then find this game quick, or if you still have this hold on to it.</td><td>One of, if not the, best comic licensed 16-bit game ever</td><td>1038614400</td><td>1</td><td>278</td><td>1290</td><td>9</td><td>4.640287769784172</td><td>30.88888888888889</td><td>0.23576549</td><td>805</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>7339</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>02 9, 2011</td><td>B00002ST6R</td><td>Ryan Sil.

However, I played a couple of the NES games. Batman Forever was based off of a movie, but the game is actually fairly good. Unfortunately, there are flaws. As soon as you start playing the game, you'll realize that it is kind of a rebuilt Mortal Kombat. It has the same control scheme and the game is even made by Acclaim. It you like Mortal Kombat games, then this might be good news for you. Although it shares the controls with Mortal Kombat, there are, of course, new additions, such as the grappling hook and the Batarang. The grappling hook might take some getting used to. What has me dock a star off this review is that the challenge feels cheap at times. There is a way or two how more than half your health will drain from an enemy using their attack (Not the standard fighting moves). Everything else is great. If you are playing with a 3-button controller, you must press B and C (at the same time) + Up to shoot up. If you press all buttons at the same time, you just jump. And as for jumping down a hole, you must press C + Down. If you're using a 6-button controller, then you just need to use the Y button for the grappling hook instead of B and C. At least it isn't as terrible how the Super Nintendo version had it (Select + Up...Down + R) The graphics are really amazing for a Genesis game. Digitizing the actors...just like Mortal Kombat. The backgrounds are also dark and stylish. To think that Batman Forever would've actually made itself at home on the Sega 32x. The sound effects are also pretty cool, although you'd hear smacks and punches most of the time. And sometimes, you might not understand what the voice is saying when you collect a riddle (We could blame Genesis hardware for that, maybe). The most frustrating aspect of this game is the fact that there isn't a save feature. Now, there are video games in which you don't even need to save your game. But here, it's pretty lengthy. Plus, the game gets kinda hard at times. What's really awesome about this game is how you can play with another player in a co-op mode (Co-op Mortal Kombat, eh?). However, that might make the game kinda harder. There's also a Training mode. This mode has you beat up enemies until you die. Just keep progressing through difficulty levels, beating up punks. You can play as any character you want here. Even all the enemies (Pick the guy with the flamethrower) and Two-Face. This could just be a Genesis game itself, considering how some popular Genesis games don't have this mode. You can also play with a friend HERE, which is where things get really fun. Also in Training Mode, you can battle your friend. This is where it's just Mortal Kombat: Batman Edition all the way!

Maximum Carnage is based on the mid-nineties massive event that took place in the Spider-Man comics in which Spidey had to team up with Venom to take on Carnage in a ravaged New York. In the game, you can play as Spidey or Venom, and you pretty much do all as I described above, and thats about it. Almost none of these games had any kind of save feature, and Maximum Carnage is one of these games, and it is a painstakingly long game to finish and does offer some high difficulty. Maximum Carnage's few saving graces are the game's music provided by Green Jelly (although it sounds a bit generic at times considering the Genesis didn't have the best soundchip imaginable) and the fluid and colorful graphics. There are a few guest appearances from other heroes (Firestar, Captain America) and you've got some tough villians in Carnage, Shreik, Doppleganger, and Demogoblin, but other than that Maximum Carnage is only a bit better than the heap of comic licensed 16-bit beat 'em ups.</td><td>One of the better comic licensed games of the 16 bit era</td><td>1049155200</td><td>1</td><td>257</td><td>1188</td><td>7</td><td>4.622568093385214</td><td>36.714285714285715</td><td>0.08764587</td><td>805</td></tr><tr><td>A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E</td><td>7432</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>03 29, 2012</td><td>B00002ST7F</td><td>Richard Baker</td><td>The Good: Fast paced 2D action, great level design, amazing music The Bad: Tails is annoying, not so hot multiplayer, can be very difficult at times Wow this game brought back so many memories after beating it on Sega Genesis Collection.

The only problems were the addition of Tails which was COMPLETELY pointless all he did was get in the way.

The action is much more atraightfoward and simpler compared to other games (Most enemies die in one hit), but it's also very well-polished. The graphics and music are extremely appealing to the eye/ear. In fact, some tunes sound like they could be right at home on the Sega Genesis. Konami really knew how to rock out that Game Boy sound chip!

The spin dash move is introduced 2. 7 full zones with 3 1-act ones. 3. Tails 4. Different Special Stages The special stages are entirely different from the first game. Now you must run through a halfpipe, collecting rings to get Chaos Emeralds. However, this is easier said than done. The sound and music are, once again, excellent. The graphics are also great, as they are an improvement of Sonic 1's. What's really great about this game is the multiplayer mode. While you do have to compete against the other player in finishing the levels first (or getting higher scores), you guys also have to beat those 4 multiplayer zones altogether! Overall, the game is awesome and challenging. This is the Sonic game all fans should get. UPDATE: I found out a really cool Easter egg. In 1-Player mode, someone can actually control Tails as the second player! This is pretty much the closest thing to a 2-Player co-op mode. Although Sonic still hogs the camera, your friend can help collect rings, defeat the bosses, get rings in special stages, and he/she can just plain goof off.

As NBA Hang Time was set to commence, many people had no idea of how good this game was going to be. NBA Hang Time was the very first full-length Basketball video game for the Nintendo 64, giving newcomers who had just bought the smash console a chance to really get some air. Hang Time had also created something new to the mix that makes it all seem interesting. The game is a bit similar to NBA Jam, but there was something a little different. The game also included a create a player mode, a mode where instead of speding a few quarters at the arcade, you can createyour very own basketball player, by controlling how tall you want him, how good he can block you, and even how good his aim is for the hoop.

Yup, the honor goes to the Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat II. I bought this game when it first came out because I was stupidly riding on the success of the Mortal Kombat series at the time.  I was very naive (all my friends were right!) Time hasn't been kind to this game, but who am I kidding?  Time wasn't kind to this game the day it came out because it was an absolute piece of plastic trash then, and it's trash now.  It will forever remain trash.  It's so trashy, the trashman won't even take it.  He says it stinks too much, and it's not worth the risk of potentially sniffing the horrible odor *just* to put the game in the back of his truck.  Even if he were to wear the thickest pair of gloves in the world, he doesn't want to risk the smell remaining on his skin permanently. So why am I bashing the game so hard?  Because you get fewer fighters, fewer levels, HORRIBLE black and white graphics, and the worst part- an extremely slow framerate.  The blood doesn't even exist.  Okay there's blood, but watching it on a hard-to-see black and white screen, would you even call that blood?  No, you wouldn't (and shouldn't). I would rather have a job being a janitor in an elementary school and having to clean up barf on the cafeteria floors every day, than play the Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat II ever again.  It's really that bad.  At least then, you can swirl the puke around with a mop and have some fun. For the love of God and all his wonderful adorable Earthly creatures- DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!

Loaded marks one of the first, not to mention finest, nonstop shooting games released back in 1996. You can pick between 6 characters, each with their own special shooting weapon.  It's pretty cool how each weapon has a very distinct look for each character.  One character called Mamma, has a thick-looking laser beam that just smears any enemies that happen to be standing in the way. The look of the game is from a top-down perspective, and the game is incredibly fast and bloody.  The idea is to collect keys and health packs in order to advance to the next area.  All the stages are like mazes.  I forget how many stages their are, but you will discover a LOT of them. There's music on this disc if you put the game in a CD player.  Really melodic, catchy music that isn't anywhere in the game.  It's good.  Try it. My father played the first level of Loaded on an old demo disc and didn't think the game was that great.  He said going around shooting everything that moves is boring and mindless.  However, going around shooting is exactly what I like.  If that's what you like, this game won't disappoint. There's a cheat code to fill up on infinite amounts of health if you happen to think the game is too hard, and need help.  Also worth noting is that the Saturn version is equally as good.

The game showcased unlike anything imaginable with its high energy, and exterme driving. Nevertheless, any game worth driving always needs a second opinion. It is important to see it to know if you like it. When San Francisco Rush came out in 1997, it was a little more crazy unlike anything I've ever raced. The graphics were just amazing, but unfortunately, the controls were just a little bit awkward, and hard to steer through the streets of San Francisco. The game anyway features six tracks to choose from, three not released in the arcades, and a extra special hidden track. Before it was a choice in Rush 2, it was featured here, Alcatraz. The amazing course did have some cuts, but it wasn't that extreme until nearly a year later. The game also features a couple of hidden cars to seek, while driving. There are hidden keys located on the street, unlocking 2 cars to choose from, once there accessed, a hidden taxi cab, and a devilish prowler. Although there were two different versions of Rush that came out during the time, one for Playstation, the other for Nintendo 64, they both seemed a little bit flawed, but enjoyable. Nevertheless, if you had a choice, I would suggest picking up Rush 2 Extreme Racing U.S.A. for Nintendo 64. But, unfortunately, for Playstation buffs, that was the last Rush there was.

It's nothing compared to the Donkey Kong Country series because of several problems.  Granted the final 30% of the game is an improvement admittedly.  It's sort of baffling to me that Nintendo would get rid of a successful winning formula (straightforward 2D-style platforming, staggering enemy variety and several dangerous encounters with them) in exchange for an incomplete open world exploration adventure.  That in itself is just a slight problem however.  I could live and possibly even love an open 3D adventure if it had been executed properly.  Sadly this game is just all over the place and never settles into a permanent entertaining groove. Donkey Kong 64 is just strange.  While it's unique and atmospheric to explore a huge 3D world of jungles, caves, factories, icy caves, castles and Aztec areas many of which are obviously trademark locations of the Donkey Kong series, the problem is that the game is designed so you have to collect a LOT, make that WAY TOO MANY, different things (mainly bananas, berries, blueprints, crystals, coins and film used to snap photos of floating dancing fairies (which awards the gamer banana medals).  Let me stress again if it wasn't clear enough the first time- there's a LOT to collect in this game.  Since Nintendo made the strange decision to place so much emphasis on collecting and more collecting, that's basically all you do for 80% of the exploration.  Well besides trying to land tricky platform jumps and battle the controls and camera angles which are often times wonky, sensitive and undependable.  Where *are* all the enemies?  Other than the outside of Creepy Castle, you won't see hordes of enemies hanging out together like in the DKC series.  Basically you could very well travel between different caves, lakes and other areas without encountering a single enemy.  I can't get much replay value from simply collecting all the time.  The game needs more substance than relying almost entirely on collecting (even if the atmosphere is nice).  The one enemy I like are the ones that swing a big spiked club around since they're entertaining and inventive.  Otherwise the enemies are the same ones we've seen in the DKC series but spaced apart throughout overlarge environments. It's incredibly easy to get lost in this game given the size of the world you explore.  So easy in fact, that I can't walk very far without having to resort to an online walkthrough to help me figure out where I am and where I'm supposed to go next.  While some might like this games gigantic size, I prefer a shorter more straightforward approach to the Donkey Kong series.  This is only a minor complaint, but your animal friends are limited to a couple rare appearances by Rambi, Enguarde and Squawks.  Very limited selection most likely because the emphasis lies on the Kong's themselves.  I also have mixed feelings with your life meter which is made up of watermelons.  Every time you take a hit a slice of watermelon is removed from your meter (and when you defeat enemies slices of watermelon appear on the ground as a way to get some of your health back).  However I understand the reason behind this- this game, specifically the boss fights, can be relentless and quick which requires a bunch of health just to stay alive. Now to mention something positive- the graphics are *extraordinary* by the N64 standards.  Yes you will see occasional blockiness, but it's usually an uncommon occurrence.  The console takes full advantage of a beautifully presented 3D world with believable jungle features that recall the same kind of magic from the Donkey Kong Country days.  The music... that's a disappointing one however.  The game is probably going for atmosphere, but the actual notes are only catchy during specific moments (such as Diddy riding a jetpack- I enjoy the drumming and guitar there) and the heavier guitar parts in other areas.  Most of the time the soundtrack is forgettable.  At least it feels that way in the main areas while you venture around exploring (or in other words where you spend half of your time).  Occasionally some short-lived songs might perk your attention. Donkey Kong 64 does have boss fights which are arguably harder than the ones in the DKC series which is a huge benefit.  MUCH harder in fact, such as that one boss that bounces from block to block increasing in speed as he gets closer to his demise.  The red dragon fight offers eye candy excitement as well.  Also, there *is* a nice feeling of pleasantness and calmness in exploring the jungles and caves.  Even if jungle exploration collect-a-thon objectives are not what I personally prefer in a 3D Donkey Kong game, I can at least admit that, atmospherically, the game's very nice.  The ability to punch or the equivalent of punching (such as hair slapping with Tiny) is a decent feature.  Sometimes it's fun to just walk up to an enemy and punch their lights out!  At times that's your only means of eliminating them since they often pose a distraction. There's a distinct childish tone to the entire game as well, such as whenever you have to pop colored balloons to release items (which is often- hundreds of times in fact).  Bananas and balloons are colored in such a way that only specific Kongs can grab them.  It just seems like a really silly concept to make the game in such a way but of course, that's how Nintendo is milking Donkey Kong 64 for all its worth.  Padding is the key word to describe this game.  If I haven't mentioned it yet, you can choose between Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Tiny Kong with her Dixie-like hair twirling characteristics, the clumsy, heavyset, slow-moving Chunky Kong and the arm-slapping (arm-walking!) Lanky Kong.  I admire how each Kong has their own personality. While getting to play as more Kongs is nice and a very constant feature you'll be doing if you aim to 100% the game, there's simply too much switching from one Kong to the next throughout the game (by way of jumping inside Kong barrels which are located everywhere) just to clear out areas and obtain all the key items.  I admit often times while inside caves and reaching higher areas experimenting with the Kong's can provide some intense excitement such as figuring out the right Kong for the situation at hand.  Other times platform jumping can be tedious too such as whenever you fall and have to climb back up all over again (which is often). Another huge problem is the incredible amount of mini games.  With so many it basically feels like you're playing a party game instead of an adventure.  To make matters worse, many of these mini games are inconsistent in challenge.  Some will be really easy and childish, while others will be head-scratchingly difficult.  Any ride, slide or race level is guaranteed to give you a tough time for quite a while and don't assume you'll be able to complete them with ease either unless you're a man or woman of absolute patience.  Not really fond of the games that involve launching from one barrel into another in a 3D view which proves to be less fun and more tedious than in the DKC series due to required near perfect timing.  There's so many games I can't possibly list them all.  A game inside a pointy rotating ice maze is the biggest nightmare ever though.  The many alligator shooting mini games located inside the bottom of a huge barrel however are really good.  The arena games that involve jumping on the heads of constantly spawning foes until time expires are sort of fun but can be VERY difficult- one slip up and down you go off the arena floor and into a black pit.  I'd say at least half of the bonus games are either inside an arena (with a booing audience!) or a top-down view of inside a barrel which is like an imitation of an arena. To name more bonus games- there's a few top-down maze levels where you have to avoid foes Metal Gear Solid-style and find the exit under a specific time limit, shooting faraway barely visible floating bees, using a rock shooter bazooka gun to take out swarms of surrounding spawning enemies, trying to shoot a zigzag walking alligator a certain number of times in a dark room while only having one small circle of light for guidance, rabbit chasing to the finish line, a few VERY tricky and overlong mine cart games that strangely take several minutes to complete, a time-based miniature top-down view of mine racing while trying to avoid taking a track that leads into an enemy, the Diddy jetpack games (which aren't necessarily bonuses but are highly challenging nonetheless- more like mini bonuses you'll stumble upon while usually entering certain factory rooms) are REALLY hard to control but with plenty of patience can be exciting, and my personal favorite- the flyswatter game.  Gotta love smacking flies!  There's a forest maze which is enormously difficult due to wonky camera angles and a short time limit that you'll discover later on in the game.  Oh and if I haven't mentioned it yet, perhaps the scariest thing EVER occurs- a spooky deep voice saying \"Get Out\" during certain bonus games.  The voice seriously reminds me of those old Nightmare on Elm Street films!  Anyway the bonus games are often enjoyable- just inconsistent in challenge. The ability to throw rocks or oranges or anything similar is a nice feature.  However for those looking for a more Donkey Kong Country style adventure, throwing just takes the DK series in a direction even farther than what we've come to know.  I do wish the rocks did greater damage to enemies instead of requiring the player to throw several just to bring enemies down.  Also if I haven't mentioned it yet, the play control is incredibly smooth and lightning fast.  King K. Rool's final showdown is pretty awesome.  It's basically a boxing match with plenty of humor thrown in, but you have to use all 5 Kong's in a specific way revealing different weaknesses on K. Rool's body that will ultimately bring him down.  The whole concept is creative, but a little silly too.  The silliness makes him seem less threatening/impactful in my opinion.  It's not necessarily a Punch Out style game either. Oh and what's up with Candy and that mermaid?  A little *too* revealing in both their text (expect a hilariously inappropriate and confusing \"watermelon\" comment the first time you talk to Candy, LOL!) and the way they entice male gamers with their body movements... hard to believe Nintendo would allow this given the age group the DK series is intended for.  Expect strangeness with an overlong and out of place rap parody in the beginning of the game too, which is the first thing you see upon starting up DK64.  I like it however, but it's REALLY long.  I wish Cranky Kong was actually cranky- he's pretty tame this time around.  Hardly any criticisms for our monkey friends! Overall tediousness is a common aspect to Donkey Kong 64 since you're expected to grab *every single coin and banana* in order to fully complete the game, and the childish tone with all the musical instrument playing and colored balloon popping/bananas not to mention some really basic vine-swinging mini games... all these features make it nearly impossible not to criticize for those who remember Donkey Kong from the 80's and the way the games in the Donkey Kong series have advanced until now.  To go from \"item collecting overload\" to \"let's play a plethora of different mini games with no consistency in challenge\" is a strange, almost unfocused execution of ideas. But with all that said, for at least one playthrough... perhaps Donkey Kong 64 is overlong and surely lacks replay value since you'll never want to play through a game like this ever again, but the first time through it's a pretty good game. I will recommend this game because it's entirely likely you'll have a different reaction than the one I have, but please pick up the Donkey Kong Country games first (all 3 of them, and then if you're still in the mood for more banana-grabbing madness pick up DKC Returns and Tropical Freeze for the Wii/Wii U).  Overall, a good game deserving of a 4-star rating.</td><td>okay monkey stuff</td><td>1418083200</td><td>0</td><td>2157</td><td>9952</td><td>98</td><td>4.61381548446917</td><td>22.010204081632654</td><td>0.058283817</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E</td><td>7807</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>03 29, 2012</td><td>B00002STKH</td><td>Richard Baker</td><td>The Good: Classic platforming gameplay, decent story, lots of places to go, lots of different things to kill The Bad: No sense of direction what-so-ever can make you lost easily, cheap deaths I remember Tomba! back when I was a kid.

You are a caveman looking dude with pink hair who naps under a tree one day and an evil pig comes and swipes your bracelet your grandfather gave you. You try to recover it but you wind up doing more than just that. While the game has great platforming abilities it's plagued with cheap deaths and not being able to find your way most of the time. With no map or any hints what-so-ever it can make things frustrating. While the game sports many different enemies and environments it makes you feel like some thing's missing anyway. The main draw to this game was the unique idea of 2D and 3D mixed platforming. There are two parts of each level but one is behind each other. You can jump down from 2D platforms and come out of it like you would in a 3D game. This was both trippy and unique at the time.

Some segments of this game are just impossible to pass or to figure out. I don't know if the developers play tested the WHOLE game but if they did they were cheating. The story is pretty good here: You play as Abe who has to save his race from being slaves from the Mudokans. This time they are turning his people into a strange drink...yeah weird plot I know but it works. The graphics and audio in this game are superb and DOESN'T look like a PS1 game one bit...and that's a good thing. The game sports beautiful pre-rendered backgrounds and the characters are very well designed. The gameplay is what's different from most platformers...you can't jump on people or shoot people. This isn't Mario or Metroid here this is Abe. You have to defeat enemies by either possessing them with your mind and walking them off ledges, walking them into traps, or just plain old avoid them. You can hide in shadows as well. You have to save your pals by having them help you turn valves etc. There are different effects your pals can have such as being slap happy which, as the name says, you need to slap them so you can sneak by sleeping enemies. The game play is always mixed up with disarming bombs, solving puzzles etc. If you can look past the game's extreme difficulty then go for it.</td><td>Wonderful atmosphere and story is plagued by extreme difficulty</td><td>1332979200</td><td>0</td><td>313</td><td>1401</td><td>27</td><td>4.476038338658147</td><td>11.592592592592593</td><td>0.07292328</td><td>471</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>7964</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>08 10, 2014</td><td>B00002STJH</td><td>Bryan</td><td>You know when I sit here and think about it, does Mega Man 8 do *anything* right?  Oh sure I'm giving the game 3 stars because I'm such a big Mega Man fan and willing to defend even the worst moments of the series, but let's be honest- this game is mediocre the entire way through.  Not to mention gives the STRONG impression that Capcom tried to make too many changes and just about all of them fall flat on their face. Let's talk about the levels.  Why does it seem like Capcom has done everything in their power to make sure these levels don't even remotely resemble the ones from the NES days?  I understand we're talking about a 32-bit system with the Playstation (and Saturn) so obviously the graphics will look significantly prettier than the ones from the NES and Super NES, but instead of running and gunning and strategically/excitedly shooting apart robot foes like most respectable Mega Man titles, this game implements too many unrelated ideas and thinks it's okay to pass them off as legitimate levels.  This is the same reason X5 failed so miserably. Frost Man is all about riding a jetboard and jumping from section to section.  While I don't mind having most of the stage devoted to this particular feature, I do certainly mind when several levels in the game are devoted to similar ideas.  It makes me think Capcom didn't have enough creativity in mind when they made this game.  Also the game actually tells you when you jump or slide by stating it clearly \"jump jump\" or \"slide slide\".  I don't like being told what to do.  I didn't have to be told what to do in Mega Man 5 or Mega Man X4 while riding the bike.  Why do I have to be told now?  And this stage is entirely too long.  Hmmm maybe that's it.  Capcom felt an overlong jetboard riding level would wear thin on players and they thought it'd be too challenging for us so they made it so we're told when to jump or slide.  In other words Capcom knows they made the level too long!  In Tengu Man's stage, you're mostly riding on top of Rush Jet not by choice but mandatory to move forward, and battle several enemies at once. This brings us to another problem- why are there so many enemies on screen at once?  It's nearly impossible to battle all this danger without taking several hits along the way since they all fire bullets in your direction.  This feature totally reminds me of the old NES game Gradius.  You can't really master these type of segments unless you have the patience to play the level a thousand times and memorize every enemy's location.  Anyway the first two Wily stages have more extended jet board or Rush Jet segments that hog up the level.  In terms of excitement overall the levels in MM8 fall way short compared to Mega Man 7 as hard as that is to believe (a game that was by no means perfect but better than MM8 by a longshot). But it gets worse.  There's actually a circus stage called Clown Man, and oh boy is this stage a contender for the worst one to ever appear in a Mega Man game.  First of all you have trains that come out of the doors in the background moving on tracks.  When Mega Man appears on screen, get ready to battle them.  While incredibly silly for a concept and inappropriate for Mega Man, that's not even the main issue I have with this stage.  What I strongly dislike is the part that appears soon after where you have to wait for robots to ring bells so you can jump in the correct box that warps you to the next level up.  This is absolutely terrible and childish. The music is really really bad.  Normally in a Mega Man game you hear catchy memorable melodies appropriate in illustrating the theme of a level.  Not so in this game.  This is all a bunch of fast-moving, unmelodic, indistinguishable techno gibberish that proves Capcom was more about making the levels look more futuristic than keeping the heart and soul of the Mega Man series in check.  Shameful move on Capcom's part.  Even worse, clearly the graphics are comparable to the ones in X4, X5 and X6 so Capcom had no desire to keep the two Mega Man series separate. Okay this is another big issue I have with the game.  I almost never mention the voice acting since it's mostly tolerable and even irrelevant since I normally don't stop and think about it, but in this case I HAVE to mention it since it's unavoidable and overbearing.  I have to mention how much I strongly despise it.  Yes we all know that Mega Man shouldn't sound like a girl and yet he does.  However as it turns out *all* the voice acting in this game is really intolerable and way way off.  Dr. Light doesn't sound right at all.  I swear there were a few moments in the beginning when I thought he sounded like Mike Tyson!  However there's an even bigger problem than just the voices being unsuitable for each and every character. The boss fights also have voices.  However Capcom didn't think this idea through because not only do they say really cheesy B movie-like lines before the fight begins and the moment before they explode, *while* they're getting hit they repeatedly say the SAME EXACT LINES OVER AND OVER.  This is really annoying.  Basically every time you hit them with a weapon, get ready to hear them speak.  I'd bet anything Capcom thought that making these bosses talk while taking damage would be more impactful and meaningful for action lovers, but it actually has a reverse effect on the player so it sounds incredibly cheesy and unforgivingly annoying instead.  Also let's not overlook that many of the voices sound like children speaking in an elementary school play, further annoying me with the perception that Mega Man is for children only. *rages* Is there anything good?  Well sometimes a certain decent stage like Aqua Man might come along where you're swimming through the level avoiding enemies which is pretty fun.  Avoiding spikes while swimming in a bubble form reminds me of a certain level from Mega Man 5 where you have to avoid spikes while riding an elevator.  I have to chuckle at the way they gave Mega Man a swimming animation though.  I've never seen it before!  The Gravity Man stage is alright though sometimes generic with all the block-destroying segments that reminds me of X2.  Astro Man's stage is deplorable due to being too elaborate and maze-like which is WAY off track for a Mega Man game.  The boss fights themselves are often times slow and resemble the ones from X4, but they're passable I suppose in both design and the moves they have.  The only annoying part with the bosses is that it takes an eternity for weak points to be exposed, making these fights longer than they need to be.  Oh and what's up with the soccer ball kicking weapon.  A tribute to Mega Man soccer perhaps?  Some tricky kicking techniques are a requirement to effectively eliminate some of the bosses which is a nice feature. Wily is boring and mostly easy this time around.  Then again compared to his second round MM7 battle, *anything's* easy in comparison, haha!  Weapons are a joke.  Completely uncreative.  Again the amount of foes on screen at any given time often comes across as disappointingly hectic without any time to catch your breath which means taking hits is most certainly a given.  These are mostly problems in the jetboard and Rush Jet stages.  Some of the enemies that I initially hated are actually okay now due to the realization that the game has so many other problems.  The robotic worms, spinning penguins, rock chucking apes (they're probably not apes but remind me of them), pearl spitting clams and several others are fun to battle. Overall Mega Man 8 is a disappointment.  I now realize why my high school friend Kevin quickly moved on from this game despite being a huge Mega Man fan.  He had the Saturn version.  He wasn't happy with the game, and neither am I.  This was the only game he was talking about for a couple weeks leading up to the day it arrived in his mailbox.  Then after he went through the game, he pretty much dismissed it and barely spoke of it again.  I say avoid this one.</td><td>not so mega</td><td>1407628800</td><td>0</td><td>1510</td><td>6513</td><td>71</td><td>4.313245033112583</td><td>21.267605633802816</td><td>0.022980368</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>7988</td><td>4.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>07 19, 2006</td><td>B00002STUI</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Sega fans used to eat this game up and claim it to be the ultimate adventure.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>The original Super Mario Land was a great game, but it was strange. Super Mario Land 2, while the setting is stranger, sticks closer to the Mario series' splendid gameplay. Along with the Mario Galaxy games, however, this game shows how far Nintendo can be creative with the designs. It turns out that Wario distracted Mario in the first game by sending alien Tatanga to kidnap Daisy. So, he's the main bad guy, whereas Tatanga serves as a boss in the space world. Space world? Yup, there are 6 different worlds, and all of them have really weird settings. EXAMPLES: Macro Zone pits Mario into a giant house. Mario Zone is actually a factory that, on the outside, is shaped like the plucky plumber. Although the settings are weird, that actually allows Nintendo to push the company's creativity to their furthest. I mean, seriously, Mario is seen SWIMMING IN WATER that is ATTACHED TO THE CEILING! Not to mention, he can also run across giant Lego blocks, float in space, and fight actual sharks! Never would we have known that Mario would be able to go outside the Mushroom Kingdom by this much. This game is the Super Mario World of Game Boy games, and that's saying a lot. The main gameplay is what you would normally expect. You can run, jump, stomp enemies, bash blocks, and spin jump your way through about 25 nicely detailed levels. The main power-ups are, as you expect, the Mushroom and the Fire Flower. Yes, that's right. The SuperBall flower that was in the first game got replaced by the return of the Fire Flower. Not only that, but there's also the Bunny Hat, which allows Mario to float in the air for a short period of time, similar to the Super Leaf in Super Mario Bros 3. But here, you can float longer than in Mario 3. The challenge is fair most of the time, but the problem with it is that once you get a Game Over, you lose a Golden Coin that you have been rewarded from one of the bosses you fight. So, you must go back and fight the boss again. Let's hope you don't die too many times. But overall, this is a really great game.

The graphics were a major step above the first one and were actually stunning visuals for the GB. They look ALMOST like a snazzy early SNES game. Gameplay actually very closely resembles Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World.  You've got your power ups that unlike the first Super Mario Land can actually TELL you grabbed them.

The music is great for its time and even now it isn't bad.  It's been about 11 years since its release and the tunes still play out in my head at times. The Map is used in this one as well.  Except you can't go and challenge old bosses which kind of stinks. The story follows that Mario has lost his castle to Wario (no saving Princess Daisy in this one) and he can only get back into his castel using the six golden coins so he must set out to find them in one of the six different \"Zones.\"  What's nice about this is that you aren't forced to take the zones in any specific order at all!  What's not to like about that.  However, if you get a game over you have to find all six coins again. For those whinning about no saving on Super Mario Land you can finally stop your bitchin' because this game incorporates an auto-save feature.  It works well but there are moments where the game will erase the data on its own. Overall this is still a worthwhile game even so many years later.

From the memorable soundtrack to the fun of its gameplay mechanics to really great graphics, there's no doubt that one could have a lot of fun playing this game. It may consist of a handful of tracks, but you get to unlock some if you play a harder difficulty mode, in a similar fashion to how the Mario Kart series handles unlockables. Plus, the tracks themselves are actually thought out well and are fun to race in (Don't believe me? Watch some gameplay videos). For something that's supposed to look realistic, the courses are pretty imaginative. Really, one of the major things that make this game stand out from other racing games is how there are symbols floating on the water, telling you which direction you must go relative to it to avoid \"Misses\". If you collect enough \"misses\", you immediately lose.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>Yoshi's Island was a huge hit in the mid-90s. The Nintendo 64 follow-up, however, isn't living up to it. It uses 2D graphics all around without any 3D models to be seen other than the pop-up book (Which is where the game takes place in, by the way) and what it's lying on. The main game is a 2D side-scroller in which you must go and eat as much fruit as possible. If you eat enough fruit, you move on to the next level. There are only 6 levels, though, so that said, you can beat the game in under an hour. That doesn't necessarily mean the whole game is bad, though. After all, the gameplay is very intriguing. However, the game is leaning over to the childish side, given the fact that the intermission and title screen music are grin-inducing for older people, since Yoshis were heard singing. The difficulty isn't steep, either. You can whop through the game pretty easily. Although, I would still recommend this game to you. That is, if you can look past the kiddy parts of the game. On the outside is a childish kind of package. On the inside is a unique platformer.</td><td>An at least stellar platformer</td><td>1291420800</td><td>0</td><td>200</td><td>872</td><td>16</td><td>4.36</td><td>12.5</td><td>-0.062270116</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>8182</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>10 28, 2006</td><td>B00002STFH</td><td>Bryan</td><td>When Yoshi's Story was first released, a lot of people immediately dismissed it as either an inferior version of Yoshi's Island or simply a colossal disappointment.  Nowadays it seems people generally think the graphics are too cutesy (and they are but Yoshi's Island was guilty of the same thing, as much as I love the game).  However, much to my surprise, the actual platforming elements in Yoshi's Story are better than I was expecting, and the fact the game sticks to 2D side scroller instead of going 3D like Super Mario 64 was a decision I agree with.  For a while I actually thought Yoshi's Story WAS a 3D game. However, graphics aside, the game isn't *always* impressive.  A few of the levels are maze-like and they're pretty bland compared to the more straight forward levels.  It's because the platforms themselves are nothing particularly impressive- just your average platforms you've probably experienced since the NES days.  Jump on top of them, ride them, jump to next one, etc.  Not that I'm criticizing platforms I hope you understand or contradicting what I say in the opening paragraph- the idea just feels a little generic or perhaps undeveloped here.  Furthermore, these maze levels are lackluster compared to the more challenging ones from Yoshi's Island.  Feels too much like some of the maze stages here and trying to copy the special level from world 4 in Yoshi's Island with the water dripping inside what looks like a sewer. Perhaps the biggest problem is that instead of collecting 10 red coins, 5 flowers and 30 stars which made Yoshi's Island gameplay so addicting and fun, now you're collecting fruit.  Grapes, watermelon, bananas, etc.  This is not only a rather childish objective, but not *nearly* as entertaining either.  Also, another big problem, perhaps an even bigger one- there's no flower ring at the end of each stage like in Yoshi's Island.  You can actually exit stages the moment you find enough fruit.  Really bad idea, because it means going through levels in search of fruit and nothing else, and when you find the amount you need for completion... the level could possibly end right then.  The sunburnt-looking flower in the top left corner of the screen jerking his face left to right the entire game is pretty funny though! The boss fights are an absolute joke.  Similar to the one from Mario Is Missing.  Alright the ones here aren't quite *that* disappointing (if you've ever played Mario Is Missing though, at least the NES version, you'd know what I'm referring to!) but they are soooooo much easier than the Yoshi's Island boss fights.  Significantly less strategic as well. Oh and yeah, we can't end a review without mentioning this issue as well- there's only 24 levels.  How many levels were there in Yoshi's Island?  48, plus 6 bonus levels (plus 6 more if you factor in the GameBoy advance version).  24 is too little!  Come on, the Nintendo 64 cartridges can handle more than that.  I remember how disappointing my classmates were in 1998 when this game came out and they played it.  They expected more levels.  I can't blame them. Anyway, onto the positives.  Many of the Yoshi's Islands enemies make a return, and despite the levels being considerably less detailed as far as item-collecting and variety is concerned, most of the stages are at least loaded with plenty of enemies.  Even when the levels feel pretty basic and uninteresting in design, you can look forward to remembering the good ol' Yoshi's Island days with the same enemies, and now presented slightly bigger in size.  Plenty of new enemies too, such as Grim Reaper Shy Guy's, extended ghosts of many varieties that serve as odd short term platforms, and spike-tossing Lakitus. Perhaps one could complain that the returning enemies should be different in some way instead of simply copy and pasting them from Yoshi's Island, and I would agree don't get me wrong, but it's not a big problem.  I like the gigantic-sized Mario eating fish that's not quite the same one from Super Mario Bros. 3, but the idea is exactly the same- he jumps out of the water and tries to eat Mario.  Yes it's hard just like it was in SMB3, but tons of fun!  He's like a huge red (or orange) Cheep Cheep and yeah, he doesn't like Mario too much, haha. The music is actually much better than Yoshi's Island too.  Yoshi's Island had one particularly annoying theme that some of the sky stages would present (that I like to call Broadway theater music- ugh, so inappropriate for a Mario title) but the ones in Yoshi's Story are softer and more like lullabies, or tropical-themed but still totally tolerable.  There's even a Christmas-sounding theme used in the final levels. This game is just not that bad.  Sure the platforming often times could have benefited by being less generic and obviously we expect more from Nintendo in that regard, and the maze levels are a needless and shameful way of making stages longer, but these problems aside, if you can find this game for cheap (and most likely that's impossible unless you can download it to your Wii or Wii U) then it's worth a few dollars and a few hours of entertainment.  Overall it's an easy game, even the later levels, and the appearance of the backgrounds may be rather baby-like, but remember Yoshi's Island has similar graphics and everyone considers that game a classic (including me, it *is* a classic!)

The original film, released in 1995 is one of the more divisive films in the entire franchise (it's neither universally loved nor universally hated).  Being a bit more kid friendly, light hearted and trying to be fun.  It's surprising then, that the video game doesn't even try to be fun or entertaining.  Batman Forever is a boring and monotonous game that came out in a time when creating video games based off movies were not always good... but they weren't exactly bad.  As a film Batman Forever is probably an okay outing.  As a video game it's a great cure for insomnia and a good lesson on how not to create a game. I should note that Batman Forever was available on several different platforms.  The Super Nintendo version might've been slightly better than the Sega Genesis one, but merely because of the controls not necessarily because one console was better than the other.  Let's start with the basics though.  The game is based off the movie and divided into eight levels.  Before each level you get to choose two gadgets to take into each stage.  Batman has a good arsenal of tools.  You have the Bat Bola which can render enemies temporarily immobile, smoke grenades or even a device that makes you invincible so long as you're using it correctly.  Players don't just have to play as Batman either.  One can also play as Robin.  While Batman uses exclusively his fisticuffs, Robin actually has a staff he can use as well.  The two also sometimes get different gadgets they can choose from.  While Batman as pellets and grenades, for instance, Robin has a blinding light, tranquilizer darts and wrist rivets to stop enemies in their tracks.  There are also default gadgets the two have on them all the time such as the Batarang. It may seem like Batman and Robin would play radically different, but they actually don't.  Each one of them has a set of universal tools.  Not just the batarang, but also a grappling hook to reach other layers of stages, tiny bombs to find hidden passages in the floors (and to deal damage to enemies etc.) and the same basic attacks.  Despite Robin having a staff it doesn't operate any different than Batman's fist.  The game won't be significantly easier if you use one character over another.  You might think their gadgets where they differ make a huge difference but the gadgets the game is made to favor are shared by both of them.  It might seem great to try to decide whether you should use Batman's slippery goo or Robin's Sticky goo but both tools are so horrible you'd never actually use them to begin with.  Both have the preferred Bat Bola and respective gadgets that will make them invincible when the gadget is active.  You won't find any significant difference in the characters. Each level has lots of things to find.  There are items to pick up, enemies to vanquish and secret passages to find.  Some levels also have hidden blue prints and if you find them all you'll unlock hidden gadgets the two can use.  As with many of the gadgets, though, they're not really anything special. The game has you traverse each of these stages, room-by-room, beating up the enemies, uncovering secrets and finding a goal.  The goal of each level isn't always specified.  While there is a small briefing before hand, most levels end once you finally get to the end and have dispatched all enemies.  Some stages have actual bosses to defeat such as Two-Face or The Riddler, but they're usually just glorified henchmen.  Most rooms just have you fight through thugs, each with a life gauge of their own.  Once it's depleted they're dead.  It's a typical beat-em up but without the usual elements that create a good beat' em up.  This isn't like Final Fight or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time.  The levels aren't short and snappy, there is nothing pressing you forward and you're on a single plain in a side scroller.  At first this is perfectly fine, but then the game begins to get really boring really fast.  Once you've played the first ten minutes or so of Batman Forever, you pretty much know everything you need to know about the game.  You walk into a room, beat up some bad guys and walk to the next room.  There aren't a lot of variations to it or specific goals you need find.  It's just you as Batman or Robin walking through a room and beating up people.  There are occasionally platforming moments, but they're frustrating thanks to the strange jumping mechanic that's made for combat and not platforming. All of this brings together a game that's surprisingly boring to play.  The levels are lengthy but they aren't engaging.  Were it actually a traditional side scrolling beat 'em up it might've actually been okay, but instead it's a game where you go room by room.  But doing this isn't even all that great in and of itself as each time you enter a room you have to wait for the game to load each area.  For large stages with several rooms such as the first level of the game where enemies can knock you back into a previous room... this is going to get annoying.  The game even flashes the words \"Hold on,\" each time you go to another area.  The music also isn't adding anything to this either.  It's kind of boring and repetitive... but it also doesn't really pump you up or make you feel like Batman.  Take, for example, how the SNES version of \"The Adventures of Batman and Robin.\"  Everything about that game reminds you of the animated television show it's based on.  Here you've got nothing that reminds you you're playing a Batman game. The game also doesn't play well.  There are far too many things to do and not enough buttons, even on the Super Nintendo, to compensate.  Your grappling hook, for instance is mapped to the \"Select\" button and if you want to shoot it straight up you need to press \"Select+Up.\"  The end result is that if you don't press them both exactly at the right time you end up just shooting your grappling hook to swing normally (a moment that is only actually needed ONCE in the entire game).  This sounds pretty bad as it is, but it's a nightmare when using gadgets.  The game itself makes you use gadgets the way you use moves in Street Fighter II.  This works for Street Fighter because it's a fighting game.  Here's it's awful.  When beset upon by several enemies at once it can be annoying to enter the specific commands for your gadget.  It also doesn't help that sometimes the controls aren't responsive to the inputs. It doesn't matter anyway, you don't need you gadgets to take down enemies anyway.  The only time it's useful to have even one (the Bat-Bola) is when taking on Two-Face who is surprisingly the only enemy that's difficult to defeat otherwise.  Aside from that, the game isn't challenging at all, it's just repetitive.  From stage 2 and further along you'll mostly run into the same enemies over and over all capable of doing very similar things.  Sure you'll come across a Riddler Thug eventually or you'll fight clowns in the circus stage but none of these enemies have much of anything that separates them from the enemies you're already facing.  There's nothing unique, nothing that's visually striking.  Two Face is likely the only enemy that seems to actually be different from the onsalught of other thugs you'll face.  Even the Riddler (who is the game's final boss, by the way) fights almost exactly like the basic enemies you'll face getting to him. Are there good points to Batman Forever?  Sure, but even they come with an asterisk.  For instance, the game has some decent animations and is actually quite visually appealing.  But the levels themselves are repetitive, utilizing the same backgrounds and designs constantly.  The game looks good I just wish there were more of it to look at.  The level design also isn't enough to actually distract you from the same constant backgrounds appearing constantly.  It also takes just a little too long to explore every nook and cranny of the game.  Each level grades you on whether you could find all the secrets in a stage or defeated all the enemies and the like.  Completing these tasks rewards you with extra lives but the game is so simple you won't need them... and these tasks needlessly pad out the game to a length it simply doesn't need to be.  There are no greater rewards for doing so.  All it does is prolong what will already feel like a long experience. The game also doesn't have a bad soundtrack either.  It's surprisingly good.  The opening title theme and the music that plays in the stages is actually good.  It just sounds slightly (not always but slightly) out of place for a Batman game.  But for the most part it's good.  I even found myself humming some tunes. Batman Forever is a game that's close to being good.  But the repetitive nature of its combat and the fact that you've seen and experienced everything there is experience with the first level alone makes it less fun to play than other games.  It's a pretty boring game that, for those who have time, can use it to kill two hours, but it's going to feel like it's far longer than two hours to complete.  Visuals and music aside, there's nothing that special about Batman Forever that's going to keep you coming back to it time and time again.</td><td>Pretty Boring to Play</td><td>996451200</td><td>0</td><td>1724</td><td>7557</td><td>111</td><td>4.383410672853828</td><td>15.531531531531531</td><td>0.0134253325</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>8275</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>08 18, 2014</td><td>B00002STX3</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Well you probably are well aware since it's been mentioned in extensive detail for 20 years now, the Genesis version of Aladdin is much better than the Super NES edition in several -but not all- categories.  The Genesis version allows your character to swing a sword around and contains some of the most beautiful, breathtaking and fluid animations and graphics the Genesis ever had.  Unfortunately for Super NES owners the graphics have been toned down not a *lot* necessarily but enough to be noticeable, and there's no sword swinging either I'm afraid which REALLY changes the way the game functions.  Also noticeable is that all the characters and enemies look smaller.  In fact *everything* looks smaller with less animations as well. This version is all about platforming and more platforming in almost every single level, however given that Capcom were the ones behind making this game -a company I used to trust 20-some years ago for knowing how to create one quality game after another- you can bet your bottom dollar that this game is very fun to play.  You just have to not compare it to the graphically superior Genesis version.  It's VERY important you don't compare the two (even though I'm hypocritically doing it now while writing this review, haha!) So basically remember this- the Genesis version focuses on sword swinging and apple chucking to stun enemies, whereas the Super NES version is all about jumping from one platform to another and stomping on the heads of enemies.  I actually think the Super NES has a few memorable things going for it despite being the inferior version.  One is that the game is slightly longer.  It takes an extra 10 minutes to go through this game.  The levels take longer to complete, and there's more of them.  There's also elaborate boss fights in this game and a couple of them near the end surprisingly require a fair bit of strategy in order to take down. Even the music is disappointing this time around when is absolutely crazy since the Super NES is supposed to prevail in that department, though I do really like the many different version of \"A Whole New World\" they use.  One thing that's incredibly important to mention is that I feel the Super NES version is more appropriate for kids.  By \"appropriate\" I mean, the learning curve of the platforming is really generous and the challenge builds gradually with each level.  It's the perfect platformer for kids honestly since the game provides a perfect learning curve.  However experienced platform gamers won't think this version of Aladdin provides any sort of challenge until the boss fights at the end of the game. So yeah, the Super NES game is really fun since you can't go wrong focusing the gameplay on platforming, but it's clear the Genesis version wins due to the stronger gameplay, using sword swinging combat, and the MUCH bigger and more animated game overall.</td><td>a whole new world... on the super nes</td><td>1408320000</td><td>0</td><td>506</td><td>2381</td><td>20</td><td>4.705533596837944</td><td>25.3</td><td>0.12501676</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>8325</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>02 1, 2004</td><td>B00002STTR</td><td>Bryan</td><td>I can't think of any other WWF game I prefer over Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game.  Yeah, you only have 8 wrestlers and yes, you don't have very many options either, but this game is so incredibly fast and exciting and offers so much replay value that I can EASILY look past the few flaws. Vince McMahon and Jerry \"the king\" Lawler call the matches, and sometimes they are really funny.  Sometimes the game messes up and they repeat the same line two or three times in a row.  They gave Vince more lines than Jerry, but you will hear both of them plenty of times while a match is going on.  Maybe it's just my version but it sounds like Vince McMahon is saying \"to the fake!\" instead of \"to the face!\". The loading time isn't THAT bad.  You have to deal with a lot of loading times, but it isn't a long wait.  They are much shorter than the loading times in future WWF Playstation games. But DARN is it ever fun fighting your opponents in this game.  Over and over and over!  You can deliver combos (which are fun and easy to pull off, unlike in Mortal Kombat) and a ton of really cool moves.  Unlike in other games you don't have to be fast to deliver a combo.  You just have to hit the right buttons at the right times. The thing that makes this game so special is the way the game company made all the regular moves look EXTREMELY devastating.  A simple piledriver looks like the guys head is going to splatter!  An uppercut can send someone WAY up high, to the point of reaching the lights at the top of the roof!  The pace moves SO fast and has SO many cool moves to keep you interested, I can't help but love the heck out of this game. You're probably thinking with all this fast-pace action the game must be hard.  Nope.  It's easy once you master the moves.

Afterwards you can power the blaster up to Heat Seekers, Rapid Ion and Plasma.  You can't carry all five blasters at the same time however.  They stack on one another.  There are fifteen levels in Super Star Wars and as the game progresses so will the gameplay.  Eventually Luke will be able to use a lightsaber and eventually you'll get to use Han and Chewbacca. Super Star Wars is not an easy game, however.  While no where near as difficult as \"The Empire Strikes Back\" the game provides a good challenge nonetheless.  Many times you'll find yourself suffering from cheap deaths.  Some levels are also populated with dangers that will kill you in one hit.  To compensate the game has difficulty levels.  Easy, Brave and Jedi.  All of which are fairly challenging. In terms of graphics, Super Star Wars looks very good for a video game released in 1992.  There are a few moments of slowdown while playing and a few moments where certain aspects of the environment will be clipped, but nonetheless the levels are very detailed.  Even better is the music in the game which sounds very close to the movie, only sixteen bit.  If anything, the only big problem with the music is that there isn't much of a soundtrack to it.  Many levels, especially in the later half of the game, make the same music over and over again. Super Star Wars is still a brilliant game for its time.  Gamers looking for a challenge and nostalgia will be happy to play this.</td><td>The Start of a Good Video Game Adaptation Trilogy</td><td>1155859200</td><td>1</td><td>385</td><td>1659</td><td>28</td><td>4.3090909090909095</td><td>13.75</td><td>0.13379365</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>8491</td><td>3.0</td><td>11</td><td>false</td><td>11 25, 2002</td><td>B00002ST2I</td><td>N.

This portable version of Killer Instinct is missing a fighter or two, but the graphics and overall gameplay remain remarkably faithful to it's arcade and 16-bit counterpart.  The two button control scheme makes the crazy multi-hit combos easier than ever before to pull off, but special moves themselves can be a pain to do.  Not to mention due to the fact this is a game for the original black and white GameBoy the graphics are very hard to see, especially if the background arena is dark.  Some of this can be corrected thanks to a lighting option offered in the game's option screen, but problems still persist.

Although the system has lasted about 6 years, the impact it has made with cartridge video games, will never be duplicated ever. When Mario Kart 64 came out in 1997, the field was just explosive unlike anything else. Then, nearly a year later, another mark in the racing form came about with Diddy Kong Racing. The game was just as surprising as the race that Mario Kart had left in the dust. Surprisingly, with Diddy Kong Racing, there was a little more at stake than meets the eye. With the release of Diddy Kong Racing, it took the racing game to another level. Unlike Mario Kart 64, there are three different kinds of vehicles to really choose from, instead of one: Kart-style, like Mario Kart 64, Airplane, and Hovercraft. It makes it a little different to rangle with, when in some courses you can race with only one of those vehicles, and on others, you can choose to race two or three vehicles. The game features the story of Diddy Kong and his friends trying to save Timber's Island from the clutches of Wizpig, a vile hog that holds control of the island. There are so many courses that are in the way that you must unlock in the story adventure mode. Still, there are also some other feels and challenges along the way, including unlocking challenges and two hidden charcters: Drumstick and T.T. and some very special codes that you can access in the tracks Mode. However, there are some flaws that Diddy Kong Racing has that were just surprising. First, there is a slower frame rate than Mario Kart 64, but the gameplay itself definitely makes up for that flaw. Another flaw is the control among some of the characters like Crunch The Alligator, and Banjo, the bear from the Nintendo 64 game, Banjo-Kazooie, is a little more difficult than evenly averaged in Mario Kart 64. The lighter charcters like Pipsy The Mouse and Tiptup The Turtle, provide a much better use for control in getting those challenges unlocked for a tasteful race with Wizpig in the final showdown. Although many people stopped making games for the Nintendo 64, there are some good agmes that still continue to push that pedal to the metal. Diddy Kong is one of them, if you really love the challenge. Considering that mostly all racing games are exactly the same as you could possible imagine, there are some games that still stand that gameplay. If you've loved Mario Kart 64, you'll definitely love Diddy Kong Racing.</td><td>Zooming Through The Jungle</td><td>1051833600</td><td>1</td><td>453</td><td>2110</td><td>23</td><td>4.657836644591612</td><td>19.695652173913043</td><td>0.17211673</td><td>536</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>8607</td><td>5.0</td><td>9</td><td>true</td><td>01 20, 2011</td><td>B00002STYS</td><td>Ryan Sil.

When it was ported to consoles, several versions didn't have the gore. The Super Nintendo game was one of them. WHAT?! You dare criticize an awesome fighting game just because there wasn't blood?! What greed. The gameplay is pure one-on-one fighting. You can choose from a number of fighters (I choose Sub-Zero), and then you battle onward from fighter to fighter. Eventually, you'll get to the Endurance rounds, which let you face against the defeated fighters, but you must face 2 under one go. That is what makes the game stand out. The graphics are as great and faithful to the original arcade version's. I can say the same for the sound and music quality. Overall, it's a really good fighting game that shouldn't be ignored.

We had Little Caesars pizza.  That wasn't the only cool thing to happen that night.  I also was allowed to pick out a present.  Nothing too expensive, just a little something to keep me entertained.  We walked to a video store that was ready to go out of business.  They had some WWF wrestling videos (back then it was called WWF, not WWE like today), and I was about to buy a video because the prices were cheap and I was a big wrestling fan at the time.  But then I noticed a nearly-empty shelf to the left of the wrestling tapes where The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past was sitting. It wasn't in the best condition.  The cardboard box was in fine shape, but the instruction booklet was all screwed up.  Looked like a dog went crazy on it.  All the pages in the booklet were there, the print was certainly readable, I could turn the pages okay, but certain pages were crinkled.  In fact the front page of the instruction booklet was so crinkled it was as soft as toilet paper!  The price of the game was reasonable, and the game cartridge was in pretty good condition.  So I asked my dad's friends for the Zelda game and they bought it for me. But I made a mistake.  A few days later my cousin came to my house.  I was thinking about hiding it because I knew my cousin was a big Zelda fan and was extremely eager to play the one and only Zelda game on the Super NES.  I wanted to play through the game and THEN let him borrow it.  I thought about it for a few minutes but decided not to hide it.  If I had done that, I would've felt guilty about it after he walked out the door.  He's my cousin, and I love him, and we get along great.  So I just couldn't do it. So I prepared myself for what was to come... my cousin begging me \"please PLEASE let me borrow it!  PLEEEEEEEEEASE!!!\"  I gave in and let him borrow it.  He borrowed it for a couple weeks and beat the game before I hardly even had the chance to play it.  But I'm glad he enjoyed it, because his enthusiasm over the game got me more excited to play it, when he returned it. I've since lost the game and don't know for sure what happened to it.  I think I gave it away to a high school friend in 1998.  I figured \"I'm done with the game.  I don't need to play it anymore.  Time to move on to other things\". Stupid me and my big wrong mind! I plan on buying it again because lately I've been having severe urges to play it.  You know the urges are getting stronger when you begin dreaming about it! Even though I had a lot of fun playing The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past in the mid-90's, and probably went through the quest at least 30 times, I don't think I appreciated the game as much as I should have.  I don't think I realized back in 1995 that I was playing a classic Nintendo game.  I didn't realize Zelda: Link to the Past has a perfect balance of RPG, action, and adventure, and not many games can successfully pull off such a daring idea.  I should have known that if anybody could do it, it'd be Nintendo. It's a very colorful game.  I think the colors help make the graphics look better.  I wouldn't say the graphics are bad, though.  I don't think Nintendo could have improved on the graphics because this IS an early 90's game after all, and Nintendo was in the beginning stages of finding out what the Super Nintendo could do.  Nintendo found out the Super NES could do much more and go much further than originally expected when Star Fox and Donkey Kong Country were created. I don't think Zelda: Link to the Past is a very challenging game, except in certain places, but it does have its fair share of tricky moments.  I guarantee you will beat it eventually though, and it's much easier than the original Legend of Zelda on the NES.  As for the music, everything sounds very clear and ahead of its time.  The music plays in all the appropriate places too.  The dark places have quiet, spooky music.  The music in the lighter, happier areas of the land give off an energetic and confident feeling, making it feel like Link is on top of the world and nothing can go wrong.  Expect to hear mellow themes which might bring you to tears.  I'll have a tissue box waiting for you in case it happens!  Supposedly the guy who created the music in this game is a master of coming up with incredibly fitting orchestral themes.  And I believe that to be true. You probably won't need any kind of strategy guide.  I didn't need one, except to look up information for a couple heart pieces I was having trouble finding (even though it's not necessary to find all the heart pieces).  I also needed help reaching the third castle in the Dark World (which IS necessary to completing the game).  But that's it.  And I didn't have the internet in the mid-90's, so I had to ask friends for help. Not many weapons and items are hidden in crazy locations (except the flute maybe, but it's not that difficult to find).  So you won't often be looking at your TV screen with a confused look on your face wondering where something is, because most of the time you just have to walk around talking to people and experimenting with your weapons and items and eventually you will find what you need to progress further into the quest.  So if you come across something unusual and don't know the purpose of it, try some of your items on it to see if anything happens. Excellent game in every way, and hopefully when I buy it again I'll be able to appreciate all the time and energy that went into making it.  You can count on wasting many hours playing through this exciting adventure.</td><td>A classic game that anyone can pick up and play</td><td>1087084800</td><td>0</td><td>1114</td><td>4495</td><td>63</td><td>4.0350089766606825</td><td>17.682539682539684</td><td>0.04708636</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>8745</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>02 2, 2004</td><td>B00002SU3D</td><td>Bryan</td><td>The fact that those two wrestlers aren't in this version of WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game is reason enough to avoid it.

It turns out that, as the game goes along, you're required to climb, swim and basically luck out avoiding gunshots from enemies.  Enemies will ALWAYS hit you at least once before you can hit them.  Not fair.  The game is too hard, and the play control makes me absolutely sick.  For some reason, you have to hit the Up button if you want to swim down.  Makes NO sense at all. The framerate is so slow and choppy I just decided that, after walking into a wall for the millionth time, it was time to put this game in the trash.  When you walk into a wall, Duke stops moving completely and just stands there like an idiot.  You will walk into a wall ALL the time because it's so hard controlling Duke.  Some people might put this game is the garbage because of the bad example it sets for kids, but others (like me) threw it away because a challenge should NEVER lie in just trying to move your character from point A to point B.  Please, avoid this horrible waste of plastic. Hundreds of better games for the Playstation are available if you're looking to start up a collection.

Dark Reign 2 is gorgeous, and is for the thinking strategist. The game sets the forces of the JDA  against the Sprawlers. Each side has similar units - 'guardians' and  'rumblers' as ground units, trikes, tanks, medics, you name it. The  uniqueness for this game isn't in its basic makeup or the thought behind it  - strategy games by their nature share a basic manner of working. What  really makes the game stand out is its design, and its graphics. Instead  of the old pixel-based systems, where graphics were drawn dot by dot (and  therefore looked very fuzzy on high quality monitors), newer games are done  with actual objects being drawn. Dungeon Keeper 2 is an example of this.  With an object having sides and textures and angles, it will look crisp no  matter how high you resolve the screen. Also, objects of this type can  easily be modified to react to game events. Meaning ... you can blow  craters in the ground! You can climb up gorgeously rendered mountains, with  slight crevices for you to fit through. Your units range themselves along  hilltops to fire down at fortifications. The snow falls as your troops  sneak along a treeline, concealing themselves within its branches. What  a treat to watch and play! The general layout for the interface is well  done - you probably can't go too wrong with this after all of these years  of strategy games. People have pretty much figured out what works and what  doesn't work. However, how many strategy games let you zoom in and out and  around as much as you wish with the observer camera? Your map shows the  general location of troops and bases, and within that map you have complete  control of your camera - zoom in close to the action, from floor level.  Look high overhead a full assault. Follow along behind your troops as if  you were really there! What general could ask for more - a way to  coordinate large groups of troops easily, plus the ability to see the  action from a soldier's point of view. It's great! The sound and  day-night cycles are equally as good. The personality of the troops is well  done - the Go Go trikes call out, \"Yeah, Baby!\" when you give  them orders, and you're alerted when \"The Sun emerges from its  sleeping place.\" The cut scenes help build the atmosphere and get you  involved in the various plots going on. This isn't just about killing off  the enemy. It's about preserving your way of life, and discovering what has  been hidden. I agree that for the Command & Conquer-style action  lover, the excitement simply isn't there. Units chug along. Units get stuck  on each other. The pace is much slower, more like chess than a battle scene  from \"Ran\". I definitely enjoy this game not only as a great  game in its own right, but also a good indicator of what strategy games to  come will look like, as machine speeds catch up to the ingenuity and  creativity of modern day game designers. With the bar raised on display,  perhaps all styles of strategy game will shortly look this gorgeous.</td><td>Gorgeous & stately, not fast paced</td><td>963446400</td><td>1</td><td>590</td><td>2527</td><td>33</td><td>4.283050847457627</td><td>17.87878787878788</td><td>0.116444446</td><td>862</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>8858</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>11 23, 2010</td><td>B00002STXQ</td><td>Ryan Sil.

I was just in a bad mood when I originally gave the game a 2-star rating.  It turns out Super Mario World is not just a game you can enjoy growing up in the early 90's.  It actually has a lot of replay value and years later our children can enjoy Super Mario World the same way WE did. I still stand by what I say in the original review: \"The Donkey Kong Country series, for example, came along with a similar idea and made it more exciting IMO, so, if I were you I'd go with one of those games instead of Super Mario World.  For the most part the levels in the DKC series feel different from each other (plus, they feel more creative and memorable).  Unfortunately, many of the levels in Super Mario World are all basically the same and, as a result, I feel exhausted after playing the game for two hours. To put it another way- in Super Mario World it feels like you're going through the levels simply to collect coins and extra lives.  In the Donkey Kong Country series, you pretty much do the same thing (except bananas instead of coins) but it seems like the DKC series offers more creativity in the level design, which allows you to look forward to each stage and think to yourself \"I wonder what cool thing I get to do in THIS stage\".  It's not like that in Super Mario World.\" I still believe that, but I've recently come to change my mind a little and think that, even though most of the levels in Super Mario World feel the same, that's not necessarily a BAD thing.  I also don't think the graphics in SMW are as nice as many reviewers think.  They sort of look blocky but, to their credit, Nintendo games have always had plenty of pretty colors, which is a plus. So go ahead and buy Super Mario World if you want to experience the joy of old-school Mario (the games MY generation grew up with).  After all, it's Mario and Mario games always have something decent going for them (except Mario Is Missing, but with time we've come to realize that game never even existed!) Super Mario World is basically Super Mario Bros. 3 (but without all the cool Mario suits and less creative worlds).  I like in Super Mario Bros. 3 how you have water, desert, air, plant and ice worlds (in addition to more).  In Super Mario World you just have UNUSUAL worlds such as Chocolate Island and Forest of Illusion.  Those aren't as neat as the worlds in Super Mario Bros. 3.  Super Mario World should have been the best Mario game yet but Nintendo took a few steps back (but with a MONSTER like Super Mario Bros. 3 I guess it would have been difficult to make a better Mario game right after it). Another problem in Super Mario World is that if you want to get a perfect score (96) you not only have to reach the goal in every single level, but you also have to find and grab a key in certain levels (but not all levels have keys).  This means you have to go through many levels a SECOND time.  It's sort of boring.  Once is enough.  The concept of collecting keys wasn't a good one.  I guess the good part is that if you are wearing a cape, you can quickly fly through the levels (except for water levels, and any level where the screen pushes you to the right) but that's not fun either because all you do is continue flying and pushing the back button to stay up high in the air until you reach the goal (or the key).  However, at the end of the day none of this is really enough to make the game bad in any way.  I just get tired of it. Go ahead and get it.

I often find it to be a mental block of shame. However, there are some racing games that do fit the bill with a lot of extras. With The Crus'n series for Nintendo 64, it failed the first time, crossing the U.S.A. Thankfully, the sequel was able to make the engines roar just a tad bit harder, and a little more exciting. With Crus'n World, released in late 1998, it contains a start of 12 cars battaling through 14 outrageous courses, from England, all the way to Hawaii. That is not all, there is even more at stake when it comes to these rolls. There is also championship mode, where you can try to earn points for faster speed in the automobiles, a very special Speed Demon, and custom packaging with color designs. But it doesn't stop there. There is as usual Crus'n mode, where you can access some of the greatest courses ever, including a special course that sets you on the Moon. There is also the unbelieveable, practice mode, where you can try maxing out the time of the certain time, and gain access to hidden automobiles, 12 of them. Unfortunately, a lot of people aren;t interested in Crus'n World anytime right now, largely because of the Gamecube and Xbox and Playstation 2 games out there.

At the time of Mega Man X's release back in 1993, I didn't think the game was as great as I do now.  At the time I was so concerned with what the future of video gaming had in store that I didn't give much notice to quality and instead focused on what video game companies were doing to make games look more realistic.  So even though I thought the graphics in the original Mega Man X were quite good at the time, the release of Donkey Kong County was just around the corner and the graphics in THAT game had me so amazed and stunned that suddenly the graphics in any other game looked inferior. Today, looking back to more than 10 years ago, I can now safely say Mega Man X looks pretty good.  It still looks a little dated too, unfortunately, especially compared to Mega Man X3.  But graphics aren't important here: this is an ACTION game darn it!  When I play an action game I want to go around shooting a LOT of things.  And I'm happy to report that all the levels in Mega Man X have a TON of enemies to shoot! The Armored Armadillo stage alone has more enemies (mostly bats) than ANY stage in any other Mega Man game.  The Spark Mandrill and Chill Penguin stages have tons of enemies too.  Even the introduction stage (which was weak and empty-looking in X2 and X3) will have you excitedly jumping around, shooting everything that walks or flies into your path.  ALL the stages have a substantial amount of enemies.  The stages in Mega Man X2 and X3 look empty and dull compared to the ones in the original X.  This is the number one reason the original MMX is my favorite of all the X games on the Super NES.  Capcom threw in as many enemies in each level as they possibly could (including the Sigma stages) and THAT'S what I like to see! Mega Man X also has the best music of all the X games.  You can easily remember and hum all the music in the game.  Some of the themes are slightly weaker than others, but nothing ever reaches over to the boring side.  Every piece of music is at the very least, pleasant (of course getting into the whole robotic Mega Man atmosphere helps to really appreciate it, hehe).  My personal favorite themes are the password screen theme (touching and sad) the lonely highway theme (when you beat the game and Mega Man is walking to the left) and the jazzy/dance theme that plays immediately after that (the screen where a computer or TV is shown in the background). The bosses are really fun to fight too.  Chill Penguin has a lot of different attacks (including shooting ice and jumping at you), Spark Mandrill will shoot sparks and swing around from the ceiling, Flame Mammoth shoots fireballs and jumps around, Sting Chameleon drops thorns on top of you and attacks with his tongue, etc.  And get this: every time you turn on the game the bosses attack you differently.  For example: if one time you play the game and the first thing Spark Mandrill does is jump at you, the next time you play the game the first thing he might do is throw electric at you.  You never know what will happen, and that helps make the game less predictable and more enjoyable. Expect to see the coolest Mega Man X weapons.  There are two extremely powerful weapons called Storm Tornado and Fire Wave, which make dashing through the levels a breeze.  These two weapons happen to take out most enemies in a matter of seconds.  All the weapons in the game are awesome (even though the Electric Spark and Rolling Shield are fairly weak, they are pretty fun to mess around with).  Capcom was never able to create such cool weapons in a Mega Man game again. And finally, Capcom got it right.  What's the \"it\" you ask?  Instead of making an entirely new stage where you have to re-fight the 8 Maverick bosses, in this game the 8 Maverick bosses are spread out through each of the three Sigma stages.  I figure if Capcom is going to make you fight those bosses again at LEAST make doing so as interesting as possible.  And they did! Overall, action games don't get more exciting than this, and I recommend picking up a copy of this game.  So addicting you'll want to play through the game HUNDREDS of times (like me!)  I could talk about the game endlessly.  Pick it up!

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>Remember how revolutionary PItfall was back in 1982? Well, even if you don't remember, let alone live in the times, Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure is a great action game that may please certain fans, depending on whether they were looking for something faithful or not. You play as Pitfall Harry Jr., who sets out to look for his dad through ancient buildings and jungles. This isn't any Pitfall game, though. It is an action game with throwing small objects (rocks?) and bombs, and whipping your foes as you go find an exit that leads to the next level. This calls for awesome battles with bosses and a solid platforming experience. The first level has you go through a jungle. The enemies here are just animals that you may normally see. You can bounce on spider webs like a trampoline, and you can also swing on vines (like original Pitfall). The boss is a tiger, but it can't be killed easily. You gotta throw some bombs and shoot at it. What's annoying here is how you must jump over its pattern as it dashes across the screen. If you jump too early or late, you'd be knocked down on the ground (Not saying you'd lose all your health that fast). That's one thing to think about this game. There are parts where some things can be difficult to jump over, such as that one giant boulder in a later pyramid level. You have to jump straight over it. There are also some things that you must figure out by toying around with the nearest buttons and switches you find. In the third level, there is a hidden area where you can play the original Pitfall game that was originally released on the Atari 2600! This really adds great appeal to nostalgia fans. The game is emulated perfectly, without any flaws or glitches whatsoever. However, when you get a Game Over, the game takes you back to the room where you found the portal that lets you play it. The graphics in the game are thoroughly detailed and nice. The sounds and music are greatly composed as well. The ending is one of the funniest video game endings ever. As you see Pitfall Harry Jr. find his dad, the game reveals that Pitfall Harry himself is the exact same as how he was in the original Atari 2600 game! Then he says \"What took you so long?\". Overall, this is a classic you should buy.</td><td>You gotta love Activision for Pitfall</td><td>1300147200</td><td>1</td><td>413</td><td>1834</td><td>27</td><td>4.440677966101695</td><td>15.296296296296296</td><td>0.040225502</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>9058</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>01 7, 2012</td><td>B00002SV4A</td><td>Ryan Sil. (Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>Why is Animaniacs not on TV anymore? Why don't big-name game companies make licensed titles anymore? We may not be able to answer these questions, but as long as we've got these excellent licensed 1990s games, then we may as well be happy. I remembered watching the Animaniacs movie, Wakko's Wish, a really long time ago...After I re-watched it again just recently, I went on to watch several episodes of the show, thus making me become an Animaniacs fan very quickly. So when I saw that there was a game for 90s consoles (Sega Genesis, SNES, Game Boy), I had to go and get the SNES version! That is, after watching 30 seconds of gameplay. Once booting it up, the game already seems promising. The title screen, Konami logo, etc, all has rich detail and the title's music is no disappointment. Then, once pressing Start, you get to see an awesomely funny intro cutscene! The scene shows Pinky and the Brain steal a movie script from Warner Bros. studios. What do ya know? Humor's easily shown! And then there's the Warners themselves making their appearances. They are told about the evil plot going on, and that the message will self-destruct in 1 second (Ha!). When playing the actual game, it's styled like a beat 'em up, but you don't actually beat..up anybody, although you can bounce on enemies' heads. Although the gameplay's very simple, it makes for exciting action! And on top of that, the graphics and sound are detailed, colorful, and amazing to look at. Plus, believe it or not, there's actually some slapstick funniness like in the show! For example, when encountering Dr. Scratch 'n Sniff, he jumps out of the window! And when venturing through the Adventure level, you'd knock over Buttons (the dog in the show that always ends up in harsh situations)! The game doesn't totally consist of running and jumping, though. There are segments that feature mine-cart riding, auto-scrolling, chase scenes, and more, of course. The segments really help add to the already fun gameplay, making the overall game even more fun (Although sorta frustrating, but see below). But as wonderful as the game is, it can be INCREDIBLY hard, due to you being able to die within one hit. Like many Konami games (Contra, I'm looking at you), Animaniacs consists of extreme difficulty. Thankfully, there's a slot machine gimmick that helps out very much. You see, coins are scattered throughout the levels. When collecting them, the slot machine is activated. If there's 3 panels of a certain character (Skippy, Chicken Boo, Hello Nurse, etc), then you receive a continue (Only for one of the Warners, though). If the panels range from Yakko, Wakko, and Dot, respectively, then you get to bring them back (In case if you died as one or two of them)! So...yeah. This game is great! Even if it IS hard, you can get through this via trial-and-error. Either way, I bet Super NES players will have a very fun time with this licensed gem.</td><td>Just as fun as the show!</td><td>1325894400</td><td>0</td><td>505</td><td>2417</td><td>33</td><td>4.786138613861386</td><td>15.303030303030303</td><td>0.1033631</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>9072</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>06 22, 2006</td><td>B00002SVET</td><td>Bryan</td><td>I give Donkey Kong Land a rating of 4 out of 5. I've decided to update my review (four years later) because my original review was not only extremely negative, and not only wrong, but also a bit disrespectful as well. I apologize for that. Yes, I was hating on Donkey Kong Land pretty hard and heavy during my original review, and I even reached a boiling point where I said I'd never touch the game again. My reason for that immature episode of anger was simply because I preferred the Donkey Kong Country series, and Donkey Kong Land felt like a cheap imitation in comparison.  However, playing through DKL again, I realize the error of my ways.  I was completely wrong to dismiss this game originally. First of all, the levels in Donkey Kong Land are NOT a direct ripoff of the ones in DKC. Sure, the temple, water and factory themes make an appearance, but it's not fair for me to say they are direct ripoffs of the levels in Donkey Kong Country when the levels were actually designed *completely differently*. By \"different\" I mean, the levels are not trying to be like the ones in the DKC series at all- instead the game makers took advantage of the popular themes in Donkey Kong Country, and used those same themes to create something else entirely with completely different objectives and whatnot. In other words, the gameplay involving collecting bananas, stomping on enemies heads, and everything else is exactly the same as in the Donkey Kong Country series- the levels themselves are NOT the same as the ones in the DKC series. I'm actually really surprised that the water stages, for example, are significantly more fun here than they are in the DKC series.  They're also much *harder* too.  Actually the water stages feel twice as long in comparison to the ones in DKC, which is rather odd considering the DKC series appeared on the Super NES (the console where ideas were normally utilized to their full potential).  It seems like the water stages were more thought out in this game. The stage where a squid is chasing you through a deep underwater maze is definitely really creepy (because he never STOPS chasing you) but more importantly these water stages are really exciting (and challenging).  I'm really surprised how significantly more fun and challenging the water and temple stages are in comparison to the ones in the DKC series. On the flipside however, the jungle stages are definitely worse than the ones in DKC.  This is because they're usually quite short, and not much attention to stage design was given compared to other stages in the game. The boss fights are really simple because the strategy required to defeat them is usually something extremely basic and easy to figure out, but that's a minor flaw.  That doesn't mean the final boss fight is a cakewalk though- he really tests your ability to move quickly during his final phase. Many of the enemies from the DKC series return, in addition to plenty of new ones.  Bees, rats, snakes and crocodiles are back.  Other types of enemies such as floating crabs, spiky fish, flying pigs, tornadoes (hey, they mine as well be enemies) and snakes on ropes (yes, that's right!) are new and exciting additions.  Rambi and Expresso are back, but Winky and Enguarde are not.  Perhaps that explains why the water stages are longer. One big flaw however, is probably due to a Game Boy limitation.  Remember in Donkey Kong Country whenever you run and jump you actually go pretty far? Well in Donkey Kong Land, whenever you run and jump, for some reason Donkey Kong and Diddy's animation slows down drastically so you almost hang in mid air, which means you never actually leap in the air very far... which means, you basically have to stand right next to the edge of a cliff in order to make it across to the next platform.  It seems while you're holding a barrel you jump a bit further though.  Weird.  Either way, after a while you'll learn to adjust to it just fine so it won't present much of a problem. Oh, and Donkey Kong doesn't slap the ground anymore.  That's slightly disappointing because I used to like slapping bananas out of the dirt. The reason the game is challenging is because enemies are placed in spots that sneak up on you pretty quickly.  In other words, enemies will probably be walking where you least expect.  Also, the game is stingy with 1-up balloons for some reason.  There's a distinct lack of bananas compared to DKC, which means getting 100 of them for extra lives definitely doesn't happen as frequently compared to DKC. Some of the levels are really strange.  The mine cart levels are gone, and in their place are levels involving these platforms that you ride.  These are quite possibly the hardest stages in the game, especially this one you will encounter later on where you have to jump in the air in order to make the platforms move in the direction you desire.  You'll see what I mean here when you play the game. The graphics are REALLY good.  Seriously.  Considering this is a Game Boy game, the only flaw is actually one that makes me feel like I'm nagging when I mention it- the graphics are in black and white.  That's basically the only difference compared to the Donkey Kong Country version.  Oh, and the music is actually a lot more melodic and creative too.  I love just about every single theme song.  Most Game Boy games have boring music- not this one. In the end, the number one reason this game is so good is because each and every level is positively *loaded* with fun things to do.  One moment you're collecting bananas and coins- the next you're either jumping through barrels, riding up and down ropes, swinging around, jumping up and down on tires, riding platforms to faraway places, tossing barrels, or defeating all kinds of beautifully animated enemies.  The fun seriously never ends.  This game rules. Overall, a pretty solid game that I definitely didn't appreciate when it was first released.  Nowadays I can play Donkey Kong Land and say it's just really fun and NOT a ripoff of Donkey Kong Country.</td><td>I was wrong</td><td>1150934400</td><td>0</td><td>1091</td><td>4949</td><td>58</td><td>4.536205316223648</td><td>18.810344827586206</td><td>0.020157425</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>9096</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>03 16, 2011</td><td>B00002SVET</td><td>Ryan Sil. (Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>In a world where there were CDs, companies like Sega and 3DO had tried to capitalize on the concept of playing video games on a CD, giving the games enhanced graphics and sound. There is one company, however, named Nintendo, and it created Donkey Kong Country. Donkey Kong Country was a game that proved that you don't need CD-based technology to make games with flashy graphics. You just need to put in effort to fit it to your console. How will that work on 8-Bit systems, though? Fans often overlook this as a remake of Donkey Kong Country. Unfortunately for them, they are missing out, as this is actually a sequel. The gameplay and graphics are the same as the SNES game, but the levels and worlds are different. Is the story the same? No. In fact, the story is about, according the manual, DKC's success. Cranky Kong claims that the game only sold well because of the game's \"fancy graphics\" and that \"kids would buy anything these days\". A funny story to a satisfying game. Actually, the graphics are eye-popping on the old-school Game Boy. Even if the characters blend in the backgrounds a little, playing the game on a Game Boy Color or Advance helps them stand out better. The sounds and music were memorable. You can never go wrong with the sweet beats of Kongo Jungle. Now that it's composed in 8-Bit, it would appeal to NES fans as well. The game is one of those games that show the characters on a map before actually going into the levels. Once you go to a level, you're gonna be expecting barrel-blasting, Kremling-smashing, animal-romping fun! As a platformer, it doesn't disappoint with its gameplay. You can even ride atop an Animal Buddy, like a rhino or an ostrich. Rhinos can knock everybody out of its way, while the Ostrich guides you safely across the level, though it also kills enemies. It can also float in the air like Racoon Mario in Super Mario Bros 3. One thing I gotta point out is that there is no Candy's Save Point in this game. Instead, you'd be able to save your progress by collecting the K-O-N-G letters in a level. The whole game is just a lot of fun, and I'd continue playing it ever after beating it. Overall, this is a really great Game Boy game.

I'm not sure if  developers are intimidated by the fame of the series, or if there simply  aren't very many programmers who can handle the Wing Commander level many  of us gamers expect from a good space game. While Armada is better than  most, it still could be so much more. Yes, you can be one of four groups  - the Federation, the Klingons, the Romulans, or the Borg. Each has its own  ships and bases, and special abilities. The graphics are Homeworld-esque -  very lovely, with details on ships and other stellar objects. I grew up  loving Star Trek, and it is neat to be able to manipulate the ships.  However, playing is like sliding miniatures around on a glass tabletop.  Where is the space aspect of this? Scales are not always proper as they  slide from Point A to Point B. You do traditional StarCraft types of  operations - mine your dilithium, build your base, kick out fighting units,  take out the enemy. Instead of choosing an attack stance, you choose the  red/yellow/green alert. Getting into the game is extremely difficult for  new players. The manual itself is not very helpful, and the commands are  not always intuitive. One of our test machines was a P2-266, which they  list as supported, but the machine only ran at the lowest graphic setting  available, choking constantly. Even on faster systems the crash rate is  rather impressive. I really, really wanted to enjoy this as a strategy  game. My love of Trek tried to get me to overlook some of the flaws.  However, no matter how gorgeous the ships themselves and the generated  mid-game cinematics, the AI is simply lacking and the gameplay itself is  nothing special when compared to other strategy games out there. If  you're a Trek lover, grab a copy to play with the ships. If you're a true  strategy player, wait and hope that the next one that comes out resolves  some of these key issues.</td><td>Great as far as Star Trek goes, but middling in general</td><td>968025600</td><td>1</td><td>364</td><td>1566</td><td>21</td><td>4.302197802197802</td><td>17.333333333333332</td><td>0.15626623</td><td>862</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>9144</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>12 14, 2011</td><td>B00002SVJU</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Now I absolutely LOVE Earthworm Jim no matter which version you speak of, but as far as I know, nobody has actually taken the time to explain the *many* differences between the Genesis and Super NES version.  Let me do this right now.  Just a quick note- even though I may throw out some criticisms from time to time, this by no means diminishes the quality of this version.  Earthworm Jim is awesome no matter WHICH edition you pick up! - The Genesis version has worse graphics.  This should be obvious though because the Super NES always wins in this category.  Here the graphics are darker, smaller and less polished. - The Genesis version has MUCH worse music and it reminds me of the 8-bit NES.  The Super NES has music that's extremely rich and varied in the arrangements with more emphasis on heavy bass, clarity and ambience.  It's really amazing and laughable to me how many people actually think the Genesis version's tinny lackluster metallic sound quality is somehow superior. - The Genesis version has choppier framerate issues.  Granted, it's not BAD or poses a distraction by any means, but compared to the superior Super NES version, you can't help but notice it.  It's remarkable to me how well the Super NES version holds up over the years based on the smooth framerate alone. - This ties into the graphics, but the backgrounds are pretty bland and uninspiring in this Genesis version.  The best example is right in the beginning in the New Junk City level.  The sun in the background stays in one place.  Not so on the Super NES version where the sun moves and hides behind the mountains depending on where Earthworm Jim is standing.  The backgrounds are extremely vibrant and exciting in the Super NES version. - The Genesis version has more sound effects than the Super NES version.  I especially like when you touch a Continue point and a sneaky voice says \"Oooooh yeah!\"  Plus when you touch ammo it actually says \"ammo!\"  The snowman boss in What the Heck?\" burps orange snowballs at you, lol.  The only phrase you hear in the Super NES version is \"Yippee!\"  The Genesis version clearly focuses on whacky sound effects all over the place whereas the Super NES version feels restrained in this aspect. - The crows in New Junk City go \"squaaaawk!\" for an extended period in the Genesis version. - In some cases, the items have either been switched around or more were added.  I'm referring to health and ammo.  In the final level for example, I know for an absolute FACT there's only two plasma rounds in this one particular spot below the swinging hooks in the Super NES edition, but in the Genesis version there's four.  A careful, thorough test needs to be done in order to figure out ALL the minor differences (of which there could be hundreds if we wanna get REALLY technical about it). - In the What the Heck? level, the sound those floating black monsters with sharp teeth make upon finishing them off is hilariously bad!  It sounds like a ghost cuddling up to a teddy bear underneath a blanket, lol.  Actually it sounds more like a rooster with a muffled voice being strangled.  I never thought about it until now but these monsters are basically the same thing as the dogs from New Junk City except they fly in the air so they pose more of a threat.  In the Super NES version, these particular enemies sound loud and demonic which is more appropriate. - Without spoiling the ending, the incredibly obnoxious music you experience at the game completion screen appears WAY too many times throughout the game in this version, such as whenever you gain an additional Continue (can of worms) and when you're fighting the snowman and rooster bosses.  It's overkill.  I don't like this theme song at all.  I'd like to know the name of this song though -and where it originated- because it reeks of familiarity so I KNOW it came from somewhere famous.  Reminds me of Midwestern small town parade music. - Everything -especially the bosses such as the snowman- look much smaller compared to the Super NES version.  I thought I was imagining this at first but upon playing the Super NES version last night and studying the details carefully, I realize that yes, the snowman and numerous other enemies and platform layouts are definitely smaller in the Genesis version.  No doubt everything was shrinked to make room for the extra level called Intestinal Distress. - Even though this Genesis version has more sound effects, some of the ones found on the Super NES edition are missing here such as the mock laugh that purple-haired joker creature makes at the last section of Level 5, a high-pitched \"bawk\" when the robotic rooster is getting close to death, and Pete the Puppy doesn't yelp when you whip him either nor does he let out an intimidating roar whenever he falls off the side of a cliff and comes back to attack you. - I hate the sound your ammo gun makes.  It sounds more like fire crackers.  It sounds like a more dangerous and intimidating weapon in the Super NES version. - The entire For Pete's Sake level seems like it's designed all wrong in this version.  The colors are exceptionally bright orange and icky which is a MAJOR turn off for me, whereas on the Super NES you experience a beautiful blue and black background resembling an actual solar system.  The music is especially bad here as well and hardly resembles the same theme in the Super NES version.  Oh, and maybe I'm imagining things, but it seems there's more meteor showers in this version.  This could depend on the difficulty too.  Factor in the missing sound effects and yeah, this level's not nearly as memorable as the Super NES version.  On a side note, for some reason the Super NES version of this theme reminds me of the opening theme from Bobby's World! - In between stages when Earthworm Jim's face appears on screen, unlike the Super NES version, you can't make him repeatedly say the word \"Groovy!\" a bunch of times in a row.  \"G-g-g-g-GROOVY!\" - The Andy Asteroids levels are unappealing in the color department in the Genesis version because all six or seven of these levels look EXACTLY the same.  I'm referring to the numerous blue rings you fly through as you progress through these stages.  In the Super NES version the colors of these rings change with each Andy Asteroids stage you visit.  They're always blue and identical in the Genesis version which is deceptive because it makes you think all the Andy Asteroids stages are exactly the same but... they're not.  They just LOOK the same. - This version has a controller configuration.  Even though it's not necessary to change the order of the buttons on the controller because the default ones are perfectly fine, it's still nice that such an option exists. - This Genesis version better utilizes the launching cow.  Every so often the cow will make a surprise appearance in the sky.  In the Super NES version it only happens in two spots that I know of (For Pete's Sake and the final stage) and nowhere else.  The cow even appears at a most interesting spot while exploring the Down the Tubes level in this version, which is surprisingly funny!  The cow even makes a \"moo!\" sound as he passes through the sky, whereas on the Super NES he's completely quiet and subtle. - The hallway tubes in the Down the Tubes level are terribly animated.  I'm referring to the tube hallways you walk through as you pass those big armed, punch-happy enemies- NOT the tube race portions of the level.  It's in the way the tubes constantly wobble up and down in a pitiful attempt to give the player a tacky underwater effect.  It doesn't work as a result of the limitations of the Genesis hardcore no less.  In the Super NES version, these tubes stay in place.  The sunken ships in the backgrounds instead realistically move up and down in the Super NES resembling what a ship does in the ocean.  That's what this version is *trying* to imitate with the wavy/wobbly tubes, but it doesn't look as believable. - The Super NES version plays the New Junk City theme throughout the Down the Tubes stage which is more fitting since this particular theme accurately and atmospherically gives off the feeling of being underwater.  In the Genesis version Down the Tubes plays the Level 5 music which feels entirely wrong since Level 5's music has a \"mad scientist\" vibe. - There's more sound effects in this version pertaining to enemy deaths.  I constantly hear a \"splat\" sound whenever you shoot those pink alien balls for example (found in Down the Tubes and Intestinal Distress).  I believe even Earthworm Jim himself makes more sounds pertaining to his jumps and lands. - Yes, Intestinal Distress is probably the only reason one would choose the Genesis version over the Super NES one.  It's a good level, though it's only 3 or 4 minutes long if that, and it's really dark.  It's basically a shorter and darker version of What the Heck? in both the design and how it requires players to progress upwards, but I absolutely LOVE the theme song.  It sounds like spooky church organs building ominously and reminds me of early psychedelic Pink Floyd.  Ironic considering the Super NES versions atmospheric quality is more comparable to a band like Pink Floyd pertaining to the richness of the music. Overall, great game, but the drastically superior graphics, the scrolling backgrounds, the more appealing music and the smoother framerate makes the Super NES version better.</td><td>platform perfection</td><td>1323820800</td><td>0</td><td>1704</td><td>7720</td><td>81</td><td>4.530516431924883</td><td>21.037037037037038</td><td>0.15856184</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>9169</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>07 30, 2001</td><td>B00002SVG2</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>In 1994, Donkey Kong Country had come out and revolutionized gaming on the Super Nintendo.  It was a good game that ended up becoming one of the best on the Super Nintendo.  Donkey Kong Country 2 came out a year later in 1995.  It was a vast improvement over the first Donkey Kong Country.  Not that the first Donkey Kong Country was bad.  It was excellent, but the second game was one of the greatest sequels of the 16-bit era.  The game held true to the roots of the original, while building on it. Most games of the 16 bit era are not known for their stories.  This is especially true of platformers which are always more focused on level design than anything.  The only story to Donkey Kong Country 2 is that King K. Rool has kidnapped Donkey Kong and Diddy, along with his girlfriend Dixie, are going to save him.  They will storm crocodile isle and face a lot of peril on their way to save Diddy's buddy. Donkey Kong Country 2 keeps a lot of the familiar elements of the first one intact.  As with the first one you spend a lot of time running from left to right.  Both characters are more unique, however.  In the first game, Donkey and Diddy were primarily the same.  While Diddy might run faster, they both typically had the same abilities.  Here, things are different.  Diddy has his cartwheel, but Dixie has a helicopter spin which allows her to glide.  Every level ends when you find the target at the end, which can sometimes grant you bonuses such as an extra life or tokens. There were great new elements as well.  Diddy and Dixie can always team up as well.  For one, with the tap of a button you can demand that one character hop on the back of the other.  You can then hurl them at enemies or you can throw them to places you otherwise couldn't reach.  What makes these new additions great is that they aren't just there for options.  You're going to have to use them in order to fully complete the game.  And there is a lot of stuff to do in Donkey Kong Country 2. One of my biggest gripes with the original Donkey Kong Country was that you had to find bonus areas to get to 101%.  While this was well and good, I saw little point to actually finding them in the first place.  Donkey Kong Country 2 changes all that.  Every level can have anywhere from one to three bonus areas that contain Kremkoins.  There are three different types.  The first type task you with simply finding the Kremkoin.  The second type asks you to collect all the stars before it appears as a reward.  The last type tasks you with defeating all the enemies in the room before it appears.  Getting the Kremkoins is important to discovering everything Donkey Kong Country 2 has to offer.  As you progress you'll be able to spend your Kremkoins to enter the Lost World.  There are five Lost World stages and they are the biggest challenge the game has to offer. Finding all of the bonus areas will not be easy, however.  Some require you throw barrels at walls or take risk by diving into pits that may actually have a secret at the bottom.  Others require the use of animal buddies.  Yes, as in the first game, you'll find \"animal buddies,\" to help you in some levels.  Familiar favorites such as Rambi the Rhino and Enguarde the swordfish return.  But now you've also got a rattle snake that can bounce, a spider and now Squawks the parrot does much more than just hold a flashlight.  Each animal buddy also has a unique thing they can do as well.  The spider, for instance, can fire webs, but can also use them to make platforms for you to jump on.  Rambi can charge at walls and open up secret passages or mow down enemies.  Like Dixie and Diddy's abilities they are essential to completing the game and finding everything.  You might find bonus areas this way, or you might find the infamous DK Hero Coins. Every level in Donkey Kong Country 2 (save for boss fights) has a Hero Coin.  These are giant coins marked with DK on them.  There isn't much point to these beyond, quite literally, bragging rights.  But getting all of them is going to take some time.  Some will really test your skill (there are two in particular that only rewarded as a bonus on the end of the level target) while others are very cleverly hidden. The best thing, by far, about Donkey Kong Country 2 are the level designs.  No level ever, at any point, feels too similar to another level.  And as you progress they are always going to throw in new challenges along the way.  For instance, everything in the first area of the game is pretty basic stuff.  But as you get further you'll have to do things such as jumping on a seals back to keep the water from turning into lava.  This seems basic, but Donkey Kong Country 2 never hesitates to change something up.  In another level with the seal he actually freezes the water into ice to provide you with solid footing.  There are quite a few unique challenges.  in one level you've got to keep climbing as the water rises.  You might think you can go in, but there's a piranha that will kill you otherwise.  You need to stay out of the water, but also keep climbing so as not to get caught in the water.  There are other unique surprises as well, but it is best not to spoil them for those who have yet to play.  The only thing worth saying is that every level is unique. The overall presentation is amazing.  There is an unusual amount of detail here for a sixteen bit game.  It is quite possibly one of the best looking games on the Super Nintendo.  But what stands out taller than anything, are the games musical tunes.  It is some of the best you'll hear out of any soundtrack.  Even by today's standards, Donkey Kong Country 2 has a soundtrack that stands the test of time.  It still sounds good.  There are some great tunes here.  To this day I still listen to the Donkey Kong Country 2 soundtrack.  In particular Stickerbrush Symphony may be the best track the Donkey Kong Country trilogy ever put out. Donkey Kong Country 2 is easily one of the best sequels ever made.  It improves upon the original in every way and adds quite a bit to the formula.  It's a great game that fans of any platformer should play.  With the unique level designs and excellent presentation it is fair to say that Donkey Kong Country 2 has aged exceedingly well.</td><td>Among the Greatest the 16-Bit Era Has to Offer</td><td>996451200</td><td>0</td><td>1224</td><td>5042</td><td>82</td><td>4.119281045751634</td><td>14.926829268292684</td><td>0.19594733</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>9214</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>12 8, 2011</td><td>B00002SVER</td><td>Ryan Sil.

The gameplay has changed so much from Super Mario Land 2 (Although you can probably still tell it was made from that game's engine), that it may as well go into a series of its own in the first place! Remember how extremely bizarre the worlds were in the previous games? Well, Wario Land is no different when it comes to that, but what it actually brings you could make you think \"What the heck..?\", and not in a bad way, either. These new landscapes are very interesting and fun to explore. Along with Wario's regular bash attack, Wario can collect power-ups to replace it, such as a Dragon Hat that blows fire, a Viking Helmet that upgrades Wario's bash attack and gives him a Ground Pound move, and a heart (More on that below). There is a Heart Counter, in which when you reach 100 hearts, you earn an extra life. You get these from killing enemies or collecting them from power-up boxes (As 20 hearts). As you earn more coins and treasures, you could change the game's ending scene depending on how much you have. Wario could buy several different representations of his money-wise condition, from poor (Birdhouse) to extremely mouth-watering rich (Mansion). All of those new gameplay quirks make the traditional gameplay pretty unique, making it stand out from the other entries in the Mario Land or Wario Land series.</td><td>Wario stole the series -- Can't get greedier than that /:-)</td><td>1323302400</td><td>0</td><td>268</td><td>1261</td><td>11</td><td>4.705223880597015</td><td>24.363636363636363</td><td>0.141219</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>9247</td><td>3.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>10 28, 2006</td><td>B00002SVG3</td><td>Bryan</td><td>The storyline in the game is great.

Along with all his friends!\" was the thing people were saying to each other in my middle school.  Of course the Sega fans weren't saying that- they could care less about the game or anything to do with Nintendo and all of Nintendo's fans! Let's move forward to the year 2004.  Is it still a good game?  Yes, but in my opinion, ONLY on 2-player mode.  I think the 2-player battle mode (where you defeat your opponent by hitting them with turtle shells) is quite fun and the main reason to own the game. The thing is, I don't see ANY of my high school friends anymore.  I'm all alone now, so none of those friends come over anymore to play the battle mode with me.  I'm forced to play the game by myself, and as a 1-player game, Super Mario Kart just isn't very good.  Too many awesome racing games have come along since Super Mario Kart, including the newer Super Mario Kart on the Gamecube (which I haven't played, but I can only assume is MUCH better on 1-player mode).  What I'm trying to say is that the 1-player options don't really have anything interesting about them. However, Super Mario Kart was pretty fun when I was younger.  And, you know, it probably remains a total blast to play on 2-player.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>Golden Axe is a hack 'n slash game originally released in arcades. The Genesis port has two more levels than the original, and some more features. Throughout the eight stages, you just beat up anybody in your way, as well as some bosses. You choose from 3 characters: A muscular warrior, a viking (Or gnome?), and a female fighter. Each character has their own kind of magic you can activate once pressing A, though that will use up all the pot you have collected from the thieves. Some bosses are easy, others may be hard. Heck, the second Death Adder (Known as Death Bringer) uses magic once he hits you, and that is saying something due to the fact that no enemy uses magic. What I find odd is that the Death Adder boss counted as a separate stage, rather than entering the castle and the boss being in the same level like in the arcade version. And what just plain bothers me is how Sega recolored the viking/gnome's axe silver in this version, whereas the arcade version's axe is actually GOLD, like how the title is supposed to describe it. Along with the Normal mode is a Beginner mode and a Duel mode. The Beginner mode only lets you play through the first 3 levels. I guess that's fair for newer players. The Duel mode plays like a fighting game since you have to beat up a certain enemy(ies) to move on. You start with so much HP, but if you lose all of it, you can't advance. There are no credits/continues in this mode. There are a few options that you can change for the regular game. You can have 5 hit points instead of 3, and you can, of course, change the control settings.

I was addicted to the Super NES and probably played the darn thing every single day for the entire year.  I knew at the time that games like Zelda: Link to the Past were considered classics, and most people had that game and enjoyed it (though I can remember a few people who said they hated it, which is their opinion and they're entitled to it).  Back then I also knew that Zelda was not only an improvement over the original Legend of Zelda on the NES, but also an influence on many, many RPGs that the Super NES would soon have plenty of (and eventually be looked upon as the ultimate video game system when it came to RPGs). Unfortunately, I never gave much notice to many of the RPGs back then, and instead I focused on Mario, Metroid and the Donkey Kong Country series.  For the most part, you can say I was more interested in platform games.  Back then I figured \"I have Zelda, I don't need anymore similar type games\".  Well, I admit I was wrong when I thought Zelda was the only good RPG on the Super NES, but in some cases, such as with Illusion of Gaia, I see that some games were *clearly* inferior to Zelda (despite the fact that popular gaming magazines back in 1994 praised Illusion of Gaia for being just as good as Zelda).  Now, I've only just experienced Illusion of Gaia for the first time a week ago, which would be in the middle of January 2006.  I missed out on this game in 1994.  It was probably best to leave it that way. Right off the bat I'm bothered by the life bar for your main character.  You have a series of blue dots that serve as your life, and these dots are basically the same thing as your heart life bar from the Zelda series, and your main character goes around smacking enemies with his sword, just like Link.  Okay, it's not a sword, it's a flute.  Same thing, really.  But the game as a whole does leave you wondering if the game company (Enix) was trying to fool gamers into thinking this was something new and refreshing.  Years later, you can tell Illusion of Gaia is NOT so fresh, and in fact, it has a strong, dated feeling attached to it, I think.  People knew Zelda was the better game back then, and they still do to this day.  You can't fool gamers.  Some of the animation in Illusion of Gaia isn't quite up to the standard of other games at the time.  For instance, the way your main character Will runs around flapping his arms, and the way he slides into enemies.  It looks clunky and uninspiring.  The graphics in Illusion of Gaia, while colorful, detailed, and big, doesn't really have that extra something that makes Zelda: Link to the Past look so appealing.  It doesn't have that certain spark; or polished graphics.  Enix probably thought they created something special with this game, but it hasn't really held up over the years (except with a few hardcore gamers). To switch gears and say something positive about the game, I think people are crazy to say the music in this game is bad.  Sure, it's not music you can instantly sing and dance to, but it's music that will grow on you the more you hear it.  It's really good music.  Just because you can't sing along to music doesn't mean it's not good.  This game is a great example of that.  The music is great, in every area.  To compare the music in this game to that in Actraiser.  I'd say the tunes in Illusion of Gaia overall cannot touch the high points in Actraiser, but they sure beat the low points, easily.  I remember one level theme in Actraiser had me pulling my hair out.  Nothing like that in Illusion of Gaia. Maybe there's something wrong with my copy, but I've been having strange things happen.  For example, I reached the end of the game with 18 blue dots (let me mention again that these blue dots represent your life bar).  Okay, I shut the game off, go to sleep for 8 hours, wake up, play the game... and now I have 20 blue dots.  How did THAT happen?  Imagine if you were playing Zelda and you didn't collect all your heart containers, and then you wake up to find all the heart pieces right there on your file the next day!  That's what it's like in Illusion of Gaia.  Also, sometimes save points suddenly appear out of nowhere, and you clearly remember the last time you ran by that area a save point wasn't there.  So save points can appear and disappear.  Weird.  I also got stuck in one area of the game because an item that was supposed to be given to me by one of the characters WASN'T given to me, leaving me to forever wander around doing nothing.  I had no choice but to start over completely.  I have no idea what's going on here.  I've never experienced anything like this in ANY video game, and I've played my share of games!  I can only assume either my copy has a defect, or Enix is just a cheap game company (and Actraiser is pretty good, so it must be the former). I have to take a point off for the constant frustration found in most of the dungeons.  You know how in a Zelda game when you walk into a dungeon and each of the rooms are filled with interesting and creative ideas, making it really fun to play the game over and over (and equally as important, making each room DISTINCT, so you know where you are?)  It's not quite like that here.  The design of the dungeons in Illusion of Gaia is, for the most part, bland and confusing.  You just run around slashing enemies, and there's not much in the way of interesting strategies to make it enjoyable for you to progress to the next room.  This is where you really have to admire the people who work on Zelda games.  They know how to make dungeon mazes interesting.  Zelda: Link to the Past featured ice, desert and water dungeons.  The people who did this game just made it sort of fun, but nothing truly memorable.  And the strategies to progress to the next room in Illusion of Gaia usually require something small and uninteresting (and sometimes obvious) making it feel more like a chore to do it.  And why does the very last dungeon maze in the game have only a few enemies?  We're talking about a BIG area to walk through, encountering the same couple enemies over and over.  Those laser eyeballs are EVERYWHERE and they're SO out of place for a final level in a game, and they're so easy to destroy.  Zelda: Link to the Past features WAY more enemies.  Compare the final level in this game to World 8 in Link to the Past.  Zelda destroys it. I hate how sometimes in the game you have to backtrack to clear a dungeon, which means going to the end of the dungeon to grab an important item, and then go back to the very beginning to complete it.  Many times, this is easier said than done.  Take that super-irritating vine level for example.  The entire world is covered in vines that serve as a path you walk on, and each vine looks *exactly* the same, so it's possible you can wander around for hours just trying to find your way out of there.  I can't tell you how many times I pressed pause to reach for my magic mirror, only to come to the realization that this isn't Zelda, and so I have nothing to bring me back immediately to the entrance of the dungeon.  But... running around slashing skeleton heads, bats, and other strange-looking creatures is usually a lot of fun (despite the strange animation from Will) but is all this WORTH the frustration you most likely will encounter from the dungeon mazes?  Only when in the right mood.  At the end of other dungeons you fight huge bosses.  There's a total of six of them, and I think this is the games very best feature because these bosses are really fun, and you have to try and discover the best way to defeat them.  I don't think they're difficult to defeat, except for the very last boss.  That one is HARD! Another bad thing about the game is the incredible amount of text you have to skim through.  The storyline is okay, but sometimes you don't feel like reading it which means you have to sit through a TON of text before the enemy-slashing section of the game comes in.  To start off the game, you have to sit through, even if you skim over it as quickly as possible, 10 MINUTES of text.  10 minutes of your characters talking to each other, and it's not even very interesting.  They say things to each other that typical children would say.  Eventually you will come across a love story between the children!  But hey, I'm no expert on RPGs, so you may very well find the dialogue to be the games strong point.  Given a choice between this and Zelda, make the right choice and go with Zelda.  It's slightly more expensive to buy, but definitely more worth it.  However, Illusion of Gaia is a pretty nice game on its own.  I know it sounds like I'm bashing the game, but I don't mean to.  Just don't go in expecting a classic.</td><td>Decent action</td><td>1138147200</td><td>1</td><td>1726</td><td>7126</td><td>87</td><td>4.128621089223638</td><td>19.839080459770116</td><td>0.084218904</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>9702</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>08 6, 2010</td><td>B00002SVEM</td><td>Bryan</td><td>I seriously believe Metroid II: Return of Samus is an underrated classic.  We all know about the weak abilities of the Game Boy and the horribly dated black and white graphics, but when you consider everything *else* about the game succeeds, who cares about graphics at all? Yes, this game succeeds in numerous aspects.  Let's take a look at them- The sound.  Alright, sometimes the music you hear is nothing more than scrambling awkward bleeps and whatnot, but you know what?  Those bleeps *work*.  Metroid is a space shooter adventure game.  Those sounds are *entirely* appropriate in this particular case!  You think about those kind of sounds when you visualize aliens, spaceships and distant planets. Oh, and while some sounds in the game are not very organized, other sounds actually form somewhat of a quality melody. The gameplay.  Arguably an improvement over the first Metroid because here you're introduced to items such as the boost ball, the spazer beam, the plasma beam, AND the spider ball in addition to all the regular items from the previous game.  At least here you don't have to search for the long beam, haha.  That always feels WEIRD to me when I play the original!  Searching for a long beam is one of those things game developers realized wasn't necessary anymore (thank goodness!) so they stopped putting them in Metroid games. Anyway yes- the wave beam, ice beam, space jump, screw attack, bombs... it's all here folks!  I honestly can't believe such an old game was able to include all these items.  Amazing! The exploration aspect of a Metroid game is always a very important thing.  Maybe even the MOST important thing.  Without the ability to explore a huge planet, there's not much left in the way of adventurousness. Luckily, despite being a game that's nearly 20 years old, the focus on exploration was included hard and heavy.  However, the way the game is designed (without spoiling anything) it's more like you're exploring certain areas of the planet before moving on to *other* areas.  That's how the game plays.  Still, a strong emphasis on exploration was in fact implemented. I LOVE battling the 40 or so Metroid creatures!  Each one of them basically serves as a boss fight (at least, that's how I treat them because of their relatively high challenge required to take them down). There's four varities of Metroids (in addition to the normal ones you encounter at the end of the game) and honestly, they are pretty difficult creatures to take down successfully.  If you mess up just a little bit and don't aim for their bodies properly, you will pay for it by taking considerable damage.  Even the ones you discover early in the game are surprisingly tough.  I love it!  That's how it *should* be. I also love their high level of detail and their animations.  Hey, they look intimidating to me.  That's how I know they look cool. I love how each of the Metroid varities you come across become tougher and tougher as you make more progress and go deeper and deeper inside the planet.  The ones that spit fireballs and dart around the screen at a pretty good speed are what *nightmares* are made of, haha. There's a great deal of suspense in the atmosphere too.  People underestimate this aspect of the game.  The suspense comes in accidentally stumbling across a Metroid and having to quickly prepare yourself for a fight.  Sometimes while exploring and stumbling across a Metroid, you won't have enough health or ammo to take it down, which adds to the suspense a LOT more.  I can't tell you how many times I just *barely* had enough missiles to defeat a Metroid.  The game's not very generous with health either.  You will find yourself barely surviving PLENTY of times I bet. The enemy designs are pretty cool considering this is a Game Boy game.  There's snakes that come out of the ground, there's plenty of other creatures that remind me of rippers from the original Metroid, hermit crab-like creatures that wander back and forth, and there's even a laser-spitting robot in a few sections!  Those are just some small examples.  Many of the enemies from the original return as well.  The bats are probably weak though.  Just look how TINY they are! To give the graphics some credit, they really do (perhaps unintentionally) add to the atmosphere and the loneliness of being on some faraway planet by yourself.  This is a pretty underrated aspect of the game, I believe. So yeah, Metroid II: Return of Samus has many cool features that honestly takes quite a few hours to complete.  If there's a weak point in the game somewhere I honestly can't find it.  Just buy this great game (used).  Do NOT pay over 20 bucks for it though because it's not *insanely* good or anything.  :)</td><td>just terrific is all aspects</td><td>1281052800</td><td>1</td><td>855</td><td>3867</td><td>50</td><td>4.52280701754386</td><td>17.1</td><td>0.060325366</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>9706</td><td>4.0</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>02 7, 2006</td><td>B00002SVFV</td><td>Bryan</td><td>It's unbelievable to me how many perfect or near-perfect scores Super Metroid has received from game players all across the internet.  To this day, gamers STILL have the time of their lives running, blasting and spin attacking their way through each and every area of the planet to reach the final stage and face the evil Mother Brain. Now, I'll be the first to admit that this game had me totally floored back in 1994 (which led to me spending an ENTIRE summer playing the game, much to my mother's displeasure) but I'm afraid over time I've began to notice a few small problems that make it very hard for me to give the game a perfect grade.  Keep in mind I think Super Metroid is still, after all these years, one of the best adventure/shooters ever made, but I can't give in to childhood memories and whip out a 5-star rating.  Sorry!  One problem is the challenge.  This game is incredibly easy.  I can't believe so many people find it difficult to progress through the game.  Come on, those nasty space pirates you fight in the beginning part of the game only require ONE hit to defeat!  It's funny how something so nasty-looking can be defeated so easily! And the easiness doesn't stop there- throughout the game you encounter simple enemy after simple enemy.  It's a shame, because one of the most important things about the Metroid series should be the challenge, and when you take that away you're left with a game that feels like it's intended for 5 year olds.  I just wish it was like the original Metroid in that each enemy you walk up to requires a good four or five shots to completely destroy.  Shooting and killing them with only one shot is ridiculous, especially when you consider that the weapon you're using to defeat them is just your regular blaster and not some kind of special upgrade.  It also drives me crazy how every enemy you defeat seems to conveniently leave you a purple energy ball, and most of the time you will receive the BIG energy ball, and as you probably know the big ball is the one that recovers more of your health.  Nintendo made the game so you can't lose, basically. My only guess is that this \"challenge\" gamers frequently speak of is the difficulty in finding all the weapons and other important items because, to be fair, MANY of the weapons and items in Super Metroid are hidden quite well.  Without a walkthrough it's easy to miss something, even if you walk past the same area a hundred times.  This is where your weapons, such as the power bomb, come in handy.  Many of the secret areas throughout the planet require a power bomb to break through sections of a wall, and some of these places are where you least expect, because many times there's no sign something is hidden. I've heard other complaints about this game.  Granted, they're not popular complaints (and only a small amount of people actually believe them).  But I happen to be one of those people, and the complaint I'm speaking of is the lack of enemies throughout the planet.  Many times you find yourself walking across boring empty areas, desperately searching for something to shoot.  An example would be walking from the spaceship all the way to the Wrecked Ship area.  On your way you only see a couple enemies around, and if you ask me there should be a LOT more.  To be fair, again, this isn't a major complaint, but the more you play the game the more you notice things like this, and in the end you wish more weird-looking creatures or space pirates were around so you'd have something to shoot as you walk to the next area.  I guess this is probably just me complaining about \"never having enough\".  Well, tough.  This is how I am, so you mine as well get used to it. :) The graphics are phenomenal, which is one HUGE positive with Super Metroid.  You've heard countless times someone refer to something as \"unique\" and you're probably getting sick and tired of it.  Well, in this case, the graphics ARE totally unique, because I can't think of another game out there that shares the kind of graphics featured in this game.  I can understand people who aren't comfortable with the music in Super Metroid and find it disturbing.  Just imagine how freaky the music was for me back in 1994 when a game like this was the first of its kind! Anyway, the one thing that makes this a must-own game and near classic is the long, gigantic maze of a planet you need to explore.  Yes, despite the lack of challenge from the planet enemies (ALL of them) and the emptiness of much of the world, exploring each new room CAN be a lot of fun.  You'll want to keep searching until you discover every little missile or energy tank available, and that is what a good adventure game should do. One thing that IS hard is the wall jump technique, which has a tendency to baffle many people.  You see, you have to jump near a wall and press certain buttons on the controller at just the right moment, and you will bounce off the wall (any wall) and repeatedly bounce in an upward direction.  If your timing is off just a *little* you won't be able to make the move happen, and Samus will fall straight down (not that falling down kills you instantly, unless you land on spikes and stay there).  Some gamers can't master the wall jump, while others become really good at it and think it's a nifty way to grab hard-to-reach items early in the game.  I think if you practice enough eventually you WILL be good at it.  It is tricky, though.  But when you finally get the hang of it, you'll find out how useful it is. I should also mention that the wall jump technique is NOT a requirement (except in one area).  It's just a trick to learn if you feel like it. I can't think of anything else to talk about... oh wait, yes, those big ugly nasty bosses you have to fight are SO COOL!  Kraid, as you've read by now, is a drastic improvement over his appearance in the original NES Metroid because now he takes up TWO SCREENS!  Back in the day this was known as the coolest thing ever.  Unfortunately, to bring back a complaint from early in my review, Kraid can be defeated by using only a few super missiles.  Once again, this is making the game too darn EASY and Nintendo should have made Kraid, along with the rest of the bosses, harder to defeat.  They should have made Kraid like in the original Metroid, where you were required to waste a LOT of regular missiles in order to defeat him.  I love fighting that octopus-looking thing in the Wrecked Ship level.  That thing is cool.  Ridley is awesome and packs a mean punch.  He's my favorite boss battle because it's all about power versus power.  The Mother Brain is an absolute JOKE to fight.  Even if you only manage to find 100 missles (there's 230 of them total) she's STILL a simple boss fight, and this includes BOTH her incarnations. Heck, in her second form when she changes into something bigger and badder, she's actually easier! The different areas of the planet are beautifully designed, too.  I especially think Norfair, even though it's creepy and covered in fire, is a cool looking area featuring some of the scariest looking monsters and the sweetest background graphics in the game.  Maridia, the underwater stage, is another very nice looking place filled with fish and other creatures, some of which live in the sand.  I'm a little disappointed Tourian has only 15 Metroids for you to freeze and destroy, which is unlike the original Metroid where you had to face 30 of them or so. Even though it seems I am somewhat putting the game down, I think it's a wonderful, addicting game, and it comes very close to being one of the very best shooters ever. I believe if Nintendo had worked on the challenge I would have given the game a higher score.  You should buy it.</td><td>Metroid on the Super Nintendo</td><td>1139270400</td><td>1</td><td>1454</td><td>6281</td><td>64</td><td>4.3198074277854195</td><td>22.71875</td><td>0.052798416</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>9722</td><td>5.0</td><td>6</td><td>false</td><td>08 21, 2003</td><td>B00002SVFV</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>Super Metroid is commonly hailed as the greatest Super Nintendo game ever! Sure, it's graphics can't hold a candle up to Metroid Prime and it's story isn't quite as good as Metroid Fusion, but if you're gonna make a Metroid game you might as well do it right don't you think? What I mean is we want exploration while there's a good storyline in tact. Something that the two new Metroid games didn't put together. While Metroid Prime has great exploration it's story kind of sucks. While Metroid Fusion has a great storyline (probably the best in all the Metroid games thus far) you can't explore worth crap! But put them both together and you've got a Metroid classic! That my friends is Super Metroid! I remember playing the first Metroid game and it was an inspiration to me. It wasn't some linear path, you had to explore. Sure there's a lot of backtracking but if there wasn't then it wouldn't be called \"Exploration\" now would it? The storyline of Super Metroid is that the Metroid Hatchling Samus found at the end of her previous adventure, she left in the care of scientist. But that station came under attack and Samus finds that she must help. When she gets there she has a confrontation with Ridley who ends up flying away with the Metroid hatchling and Samus tracks him down to planet Zebes. This is a great storyline! Some landscapes look a lot like those of the original Metroid game but enhanced. Some abilities are even in the same spots! Still, that exploration is there and for that I was happy.  Instead of having a linear path to follow you can play the game at your own pace and find the power-ups how you want to find them.  Exploration in my opinion is what Metroid games are all about. As far as difficulty goes, this Metroid game is REALLY easy compared to the original NES one and the newer Metroid Prime.  It's about the same as Metroid Fusion, meaning that if you know how to take on something you'll undoubtably come out of nearly every confrontation without a scratch. I have only ONE gripe with this game. That is the default control settings.  Thank goodness Nintendo has allowed us to change them!  The default control scheme is TERRIBLE (using the X button to shoot?) and it's better that you can customize the controls. Now, as far as games go I think Super Metroid is one of the greatest games every made! It would be on my top ten list of the greatest games ever and I'm happy to have gotten the oppertunity to play this. If you want an example of how a Metroid game, let alone Action/Adventure then this is a great example!

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>In a world where there were CDs, companies like Sega and 3DO had tried to capitalize on the concept of playing video games on a CD, giving the games enhanced graphics and sound. There is one company, however, named Nintendo, and it created Donkey Kong Country. Donkey Kong Country was a game that proved that you don't need CD-based technology to make games with flashy graphics. You just need to put in effort to fit it to your console. DKC's graphics were incredible on the Super Nintendo. The game almost looked like the characters came from a CGI movie. At least, at its time. Even the backgrounds had tons of details and neat movements. The sounds and music were memorable. Even when you defeat a Kremling (alligator enemy), his voice effect when he dies will always be remembered for a long time. As for the music, well, you can never go wrong with the sweet beats of Kongo Jungle and the King K. Rool boss battle. The game is one of those games that show the characters on a map before actually going into the levels. Once you go to a level, you're gonna be expecting barrel-blasting, Kremling-smashing, animal-romping fun! There is a lot to do in Donkey Kong Country. As a platformer, it doesn't disappoint with its gameplay. You can even ride atop an Animal Buddy, like a rhino or an ostrich. Rhinos can knock everybody out of its way, while the Ostrich guides you safely across the level. It can also float in the air like Racoon Mario in Super Mario Bros 3. The entire game is a bunch of fun. The multiplayer is pretty cool, too. While you can't REALLY play co-op like in the new DKC game that's out on Wii, your friend can cover in for you if you die. One player plays as Donkey Kong, and the other plays as Diddy Kong. Once one player is participating in the action, the other player can't really do anything. But if that one player dies or presses Select, then it's time for the second player to play. You can also compete against each other. To save, you must reach Candy's Save Point. Personally, I wish they added a save anytime kind of feature. But that is a minor complaint. Overall, this is a really great Super NES gem. It's worth the money. Even if you don't have a Super Nintendo, it's also out for Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>Pac-Man is a really awesome arcade game. It's so addicting! You just eat dots while roaming around in a maze while avoiding ghosts. And then you could use a special dot in which the ghosts become edible. This, my friends, was timeless action the Namco loves going back to over and over again. Not in 1994, though, in which they release Pac-Man 2. Look at that cover art...I don't think this is maze game. I have a theory as to why this \"interactive cartoon\" has the Pac-Man 2 name. There was a Pac-Man cartoon show in the 80s. I can only assume this is a sequel to that. Since a new Pac-Man show is being made and set for next year, why not review Namco's attempt at doing something like that in a video game? Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures has you help Pac-Man on his journey. That's right. YOU'RE a part of his ventures. Anyway, the game is composed of various objectives Pac-Man has to accomplish. He roams around all kinds of places such as a farm, a warehouse, a mountain, and much more. The trick here is that the player has to be pretty observant and aware of what's going on around the scenery. The player uses a slingshot to shoot at stuff to get Pac-Man to notice them (You can also convince Pac-Man to look in a certain direction). It's like a shooting gallery crossed with an adventure game. However, since this is classified as an \"interactive cartoon\", there were definitely some bizarre reactions to what you shoot. For example, if you shoot a guy at a Hot Dog stand, he squirts ketchup onto Pac-Man in anger. Sometimes, the slingshot could be used to help Pac-Man find ways to progress (EX: A rope for him to climb, or shooting away a rock on a hill so Pac-Man doesn't trip over it). Or you can even shoot Pac-Man himself when he's about to meet his fate, so he could jump away (or you could just shoot him to anger him). The slingshot could also be used for slinging Power Pellets in case of any ghosts lurking around. However, here's one major flaw with that - The only place I recall where you get Power Pellets is Pac-Man's house. And you only get to use 3 before running out. If Pac-Man needs a Power Pellet and ghosts are scaring him, this will go on for a LONG time before the ghosts finally fly away. What really influences the game other than the slingshot is Pac-Man's mood. This is interestingly an important part of the game, because how he acts toward some things rely on his behavior. Some instances require him to be angry or happy, and some cause him to change his mood to such things. The formula overall is very, VERY unique and makes the game really interesting. Namco did a great job with the making of this game. Unfortunately, there are two problems: The lack of places to get Power Pellets AND the lack of an actual save feature. Yeah....you have to use passwords, so you better write em down.. But other than those problems, the game is great. As for the game being an interactive cartoon, it really nails that. The game has a great sense of humor (EX: In the park, Pac-Man trips on rock, and slips on a skateboard, causing that skateboard to fly up in the air and land straight onto his head - There's also a billboard in the city that shows an anime person holding a hamburger. Pac-Man smiles as a laughable reaction to the billboard). Many things you shoot with the slingshot can cause a gut-buster. Actually, it seems like if you don't want to play through the main game, you could just have Pac-Man wander off and create your own little cartoon venture. Go ahead. Have Pac-Man brawl with a cat that stole his hot dog. Have a farmer's haystack fall flat onto him. Do whatever. If you're not interested in the actual game, Pac-Man 2 still has some value for you. If you go to the city's arcade, you'll find a fully playable Pac-Man arcade cabinet & Ms. Pac-Man. Or, if you want to avoid the game altogether, and go straight into the original Pac-Man or Ms. Pac-Man, you can enter these passwords: Pac-Man: PCMNDPW Ms. Pac-Man: MSPCMND Pac-Man is that timeless classic we all know and love. Eat the dots, avoid ghosts, you know....all good stuff. Considering Pac-Man 2's price right now for a used copy, you could just buy this game right now just for the classic Pac-Man alone. Fortunately for you arcade Pac lovers out there, there's also Ms. Pac-Man in the mix. However, considering Ms. Pac-Man was eventually re-released for the SNES, with bunches of new features that made the game a bigger blast than the arcade original, it takes some of the fun out of this port, which doesn't have any of those features. You just simply play as is. Ms. Pac-Man is still a fun game on here, but I'd rather recommend getting the standalone SNES version, which makes one of the greatest games of all time that much better. All in all, Pac-Man 2 is a should-have. If you're a cartoon fanatic, you should pick this up right away. If you are looking for an unexpected challenge, the game certainly has that. If you are a Pac-Man fan, and wish for arcade-style action, Pac-Man 2 still offers the arcade classic and Ms. Pac-Man to satisfy your needs.

A 2-Player Vs Mode to see who can kill the aliens faster is a nice addition to the faithful adaptation. But you see - The main problem that prevents this from getting 5 stars isn't the game's own fault. It's that there are so many other shooters on the Super Nintendo, let alone the other systems, that go beyond the heights of this game. I gave the Atari 2600 version of Space Invaders 5 stars due to its brand-new game modes that make the game itself more fresh and fun. Take even the most similar games in the lot, like Galaga. It's gameplay is identical to that of Space Invaders, but it allows the player to shoot multiple missles at once, and the aliens dive toward the player's aircraft. Space Invaders has a slightly duller feel compared to Galaga. However, if you're a Space Invaders fan, this Super Nintendo version won't disappoint, as it is just like the arcade original.

Much like Tetris, Intelligence Qube was a game that was nothing short of simplistic.  Because of its simplistic formula, however, it was a widely addictive game that really forced you to use your brain.  Unfortunately, the game is extremely rare these days and like many rare highly sought after video games, comes at ridiculous prices. A game has never been simpler to learn than Intelligent Qube.  Each level has several rows.  Then the cubes begin to \"march\" forward.  The entire point of the game is to capture cubes.  You simply press X to lay down a trap and then X again to capture it.  There are a couple of complexities to the gameplay that make it quite a challenge.  For one, while your goal is to capture cubes, there are certain cubes that you shouldn't capture.  These are forbidden cubes, and the penalty for capturing one is losing a row of the level you're on.  There are also green cubes called advantage cubes.  Capturing these allows you to set a trap that will capture all the surrounding cubes.  At first, Intelligent Qube seems easy, but the game is much more complex than you think.  As the game progresses, the cubes march forward and there are more rows of cubes to deal with.  Just the same, the placement of the marching cubes is completely random. At times you may even have to run in between cubes to get to the ones you must capture in order to avoid forbidden cubes.  Should you ever get crushed by the cubes, they'll automatically roll off the edge of the stage and a row will collapse.  If that happens you'll have to go through the same set again.  If you successfully capture all cubes without capturing any forbidden cubes you'll gain another row. The game is very deep in its strategy.  It's a lot easier to screw up than it looks.  The game is not that long, but the levels can throw you for a loop.  Especially the advantage cube which will even capture forbidden cubes if they're in range.  There's really nothing more to the game than that. Graphically, Intelligent Qube looks incredibly smooth.  For a puzzle game like this, it looks top notch.  There's not a whole lot to the graphics, however as aside from the cubes and your little sprite running around there's nothing too complex to the graphics. However, the best part about Intelligent Qube is easily the soundtrack.  Beautifully orchestrated.  You'll be tempted to pause the game just to listen to the music of the stages.  This is easily one of the best sounding Playstation games ever released In spite of its age, Intelligent Qube is still a great game.

Well it has been 13 years after the arcade game's release, and Nintendo was developing a new version of the game for Game Boy. At first glance you'd probably think: \"Donkey Kong's already been released on several classic consoles already. So what's the point this one?\" But if you look at the game itself, you'd go buy it already. Donkey Kong has 3 save files. When you start the game, you get to play through the 4 levels of the arcade game. But after beating Donkey Kong in the level with the disappearing yellow platforms, you saved Pauline, right? WRONG! When I saw DK get back up, capture Pauline, and run, I was amazed, and my mouth dropped. Mario was running after the big age. And now the real game starts. The main gameplay has Mario go fetch a key and then use the key to open up a locked door to move on. The levels are clever, fun to play, and just downright cool. In fact, Mario can use acrobatic skills to help him through the levels. He can somersault, flip, and perform handstand jumps. Later, Donkey Kong Jr. comes into the scene and helps out his daddy. The graphics are great, especially when played on the Super Game Boy. With the Super Game Boy, there's a border around the game that makes it look like it's on a Donkey Kong arcade machine. The graphics also shine during the final boss: Giant DK. He looks very cartoonish, but that is how the game is supposed to be: Cartoony and fun. Exercising, somersaulting Mario vs a huge King Kong-sized DK on top of a big building! The music and sounds are also very good.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>Pac-Man is a really awesome arcade game. It's so addicting! You just eat dots while roaming around in a maze while avoiding ghosts. And then you could use a special dot in which the ghosts become edible. This, my friends, was timeless action the Namco loves going back to over and over again. Not in 1994, though, in which they release Pac-Man 2. Look at that cover art...I don't think this is maze game. I have a theory as to why this \"interactive cartoon\" has the Pac-Man 2 name. There was a Pac-Man cartoon show in the 80s. I can only assume this is a sequel to that. Since a new Pac-Man show is being made and set for next year, why not review Namco's attempt at doing something like that in a video game? Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures has you help Pac-Man on his journey. That's right. YOU'RE a part of his ventures. Anyway, the game is composed of various objectives Pac-Man has to accomplish. He roams around all kinds of places such as a farm, a warehouse, a mountain, and much more. The trick here is that the player has to be pretty observant and aware of what's going on around the scenery. The player uses a slingshot to shoot at stuff to get Pac-Man to notice them (You can also convince Pac-Man to look in a certain direction). It's like a shooting gallery crossed with an adventure game. However, since this is classified as an \"interactive cartoon\", there were definitely some bizarre reactions to what you shoot. For example, if you shoot a guy at a Hot Dog stand, he squirts ketchup onto Pac-Man in anger. Sometimes, the slingshot could be used to help Pac-Man find ways to progress (EX: A rope for him to climb, or shooting away a rock on a hill so Pac-Man doesn't trip over it). Or you can even shoot Pac-Man himself when he's about to meet his fate, so he could jump away (or you could just shoot him to anger him). The slingshot could also be used for slinging Power Pellets in case of any ghosts lurking around. However, here's one major flaw with that - The only place I recall where you get Power Pellets is Pac-Man's house. And you only get to use 3 before running out. If Pac-Man needs a Power Pellet and ghosts are scaring him, this will go on for a LONG time before the ghosts finally fly away. What really influences the game other than the slingshot is Pac-Man's mood. This is interestingly an important part of the game, because how he acts toward some things rely on his behavior. Some instances require him to be angry or happy, and some cause him to change his mood to such things. The formula overall is very, VERY unique and makes the game really interesting. Namco did a great job with the making of this game. Unfortunately, there are two problems: The lack of places to get Power Pellets AND the lack of an actual save feature. Yeah....you have to use passwords, so you better write em down.. But other than those problems, the game is great. As for the game being an interactive cartoon, it really nails that. The game has a great sense of humor (EX: In the park, Pac-Man trips on rock, and slips on a skateboard, causing that skateboard to fly up in the air and land straight onto his head - There's also a billboard in the city that shows an anime person holding a hamburger. Pac-Man smiles as a laughable reaction to the billboard). Many things you shoot with the slingshot can cause a gut-buster. Actually, it seems like if you don't want to play through the main game, you could just have Pac-Man wander off and create your own little cartoon venture. Go ahead. Have Pac-Man brawl with a cat that stole his hot dog. Have a farmer's haystack fall flat onto him. Do whatever. If you're not interested in the actual game, Pac-Man 2 still has some value for you. If you go to the city's arcade, you'll find a fully playable Pac-Man arcade cabinet & an exclusive unlockable game titled Pac-Jr. Or, if you want to avoid the game altogether, and go straight into the original Pac-Man or Pac. Jr, you can enter these passwords: Pac-Man: PCMNORG Pac-Jr: PCJRDPW Pac-Man is that timeless classic we all know and love. Eat the dots, avoid ghosts, you know....all good stuff. Considering Pac-Man 2's price right now for a used copy, you could just buy this game right now just for the classic Pac-Man alone. Fortunately for you arcade Pac lovers out there, there's a new exclusive game (Pac-Jr). Granted, it's based on Ms. Pac-Man, as the mazes' colors and design show that they are, but the mazes are different enough to where it's a new Pac-Man game. Definitely a fun game to play as well. All in all, Pac-Man 2 is a should-have. If you're a cartoon fanatic, you should pick this up right away. If you are looking for an unexpected challenge, the game certainly has that. If you are a Pac-Man fan, and wish for arcade-style action, Pac-Man 2 still offers the arcade classic and Pac-Jr to satisfy your needs.

It honestly bugs me to the point that I have to take off 2 whole stars from the overall rating. Despite the fact that the gameplay is *extremely* fun, it doesn't change the fact that, despite some really small changes here and there, DKL2 is basically the same exact game as Donkey Kong Country 2 for the Super NES.  It's true. For those of you who are quite experienced with DKC2, just look at the map when the game begins, and explore some of the levels.  You're actually playing the same game as DKC2.  You'll realize this very quickly. This is a problem to me.  Oh sure, if you love Donkey Kong Country 2 and would like to play the same game while traveling somewhere with your Game Boy, this game will do the job just fine. Hey, this *is* still a really fun platform game in every single aspect.  No one can deny that.  It's just that you absolutely do NOT need this game if you own and enjoy Donkey Kong Country 2.  It's not necessary at *all* to own this game. This is the biggest difference of all compared to the *first* Donkey Kong Land game.  When THAT game was being made, the developers took the successful formula of Donkey Kong Country and actually took the time to develop completely different levels for the Game Boy incarnation, so the whole game felt like you were playing a bunch of additional levels that could have very well fit into the first Donkey Kong Country game.  90% of the levels felt completely different from anything in DKC. DKL2 however, is clearly ripping off the *same exact levels* as the ones from Donkey Kong Country 2, so while it's not a horrible game by any means, it's just a completely pointless one unless of course -like I said above- you are going on a long car ride somewhere and really feel the need to play the same game in handheld form. Oh, and on a side note, there's also another problem with DKL2.  Lack of detail.  No, I'm not talking about the background environments.  Those are just fine.  I'm talking about an overall lack of detail concerning the variety of bananas, coins and enemies that you collect in each and every level.  Too much pointless running forward with not enough enemy pouncing or item collecting makes a good portion of this game a chore to go through. Still, I don't hate this game or anything.  It's just a pointless game to me.  Pick up the first Donkey Kong Land instead.</td><td>average</td><td>1163721600</td><td>1</td><td>459</td><td>1973</td><td>27</td><td>4.298474945533769</td><td>17.0</td><td>0.025285043</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>10074</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>08 23, 2013</td><td>B00002SVYB</td><td>Bryan</td><td>I remember in middle school when this game came out, my friends would talk about it all the time and often compare it to Illusion of Gaia.  I couldn't contribute to the discussion since back then I wasn't familiar with either game but now, since I'm familiar with both, I think Illusion of Gaia is a superior game, if only slightly.  I believe comparisons to Secret of Mana would have been more appropriate, though. While I admire an action-oriented RPG approach instead of the turn based style (that I never understood the appeal of by the way- why am I *forced* to take damage if I don't want to?) Secret of Evermore surely feels more appropriate for the turn based audience despite the action.  Perhaps this is due to the way the game feels- it feels strongly like it wants to be Chrono Trigger since Square's design in gaming, while fantastic, is a pretty predictable formula.  I mean Chrono Trigger is turn based and Secret of Evermore doesn't feel significantly different than that game despite using two different combat styles.  While playing Secret of Evermore, you realize that Square's specialty is turn based RPG's and they should leave any weapon-swinging action to Nintendo due to the tacky and unnatural way you swing your weapon, as well as the odd-looking animations afterwards when an enemy has been defeated.  It makes me think Square was probably one step away from making Secret of Evermore a tun based RPG.  Of course the characters, forest and castle backgrounds and overall set-up of both Chrono Trigger and Secret of Evermore resemble each other as well, but I don't really mind that. Anyway, Secret of Evermore is about a boy and his dog who go an adventure retrieving diamonds, stopping the world from falling into a deep freeze, or whatever else the townspeople ask or discuss from our brave hero.  Probably the most interesting feature of the game is that your dog can actually attack enemies by biting them, and sometimes he packs a mean bite and is quite the helpful little companion.  The storyline is relatively simple.  At least, in comparison to the elabrate Chrono Trigger storyline.  This is due to such a small number of characters overall and the small number of actual dilemmas occurring throughout the quest.  Chrono Trigger's land was so diverse and populated that it was enough to make me confused on several occasions so I welcome the change. Overall the world feels alarmingly small and you often have to walk through the same areas you've just completed to retrieve, purchase or progress somewhere else.  You also have to defeat several enemies in order to level up and advance.  Not a bad concept, though occasionally repetitive.  Some of the weapons are horrible.  The bone weapon in the beginning with its limited range is quite pathetic though I guess understandable since it's your very first weapon after all, but the spear that you will soon get is a MAJOR improvement.  You can also create attacks depending on your level and the one where a giant fist comes down and pounds enemies is a nifty way of damaging and eliminating any danger standing in your way.  In fact the fist pound is highly reliable in boss fights and makes short work of them.  Casting powerful attack spells is another trademark of turn based RPG's so it's a bit weird having them in a game like this but it's a pretty cool concept regardless.  Some of the areas are fairly boring.  Actually when you arrive to the desert, that's when the game gets sort of boring.  You have to swirl around through quicksand for a few minutes to obtain hidden items on one occasion, talk to townspeople, purchase or trade items, and take a hilarious tour boat ride on another.  This stuff takes a long time with little excitement in between. Speaking of the boss fights, they're alright, though the one snake fight from the swamp area is entirely too long.  Others are sometimes annoying due to shaking the floors and stunning our hero or darting off screen and coming back with a cheap attack, but otherwise they're fine.  Filling your health whenever it's low is similar to Chrono Trigger which is weird in a more action-like game, but that's how it is.  Enemies can be a bit repetitive at times.  How many times did I have to battle those miniature frog creatures?  Or the boney snakes that resemble the ones from Super Castlevania IV?  Or those flopping slime balls?  Too many times.  The music is quite the surprise though.  Quite often it's extraordinary and always fits the mood perfectly but more importantly, the notes themselves are memorable and enhance the fairy tale vibes of the fictional story quite often. Overall, well it's a pretty good game.  My 3-star rating is probably due to the fact I've played several Super NES games that entertained me more.  It *is* a classic video game system after all.  Still, Secret of Evermore is a nice change when I desire to take a break from the classics.</td><td>not a big secret- it's an adventure</td><td>1377216000</td><td>0</td><td>884</td><td>4033</td><td>39</td><td>4.5622171945701355</td><td>22.666666666666668</td><td>0.0040633</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>10101</td><td>4.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>01 12, 2011</td><td>B00002SUIK</td><td>Ryan Sil. (Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>Toy Story was an awesome movie. However, is it an awesome cash-in? Actually, the game's pretty good. As Woody, you go through 18 levels that relate to the movie and follow its storyline. Since this version of the game was released after the SNES game, there are some differences that were put in the game. Some of these are: -New level -Bonus game -Level differences The graphics are some of the best on the Genesis. Especially considering its limited color palliate. The sounds and music aren't as great as the Super Nintendo had them turn out, also considering the limits, but they are still sounding pretty well on the hardware. The gameplay is also pretty good, but it's always varied, although it's mostly a platform game. However, the game is hard. Harder than the Super Nintendo game. The reason why and how is because of the new additions to some levels. The Claw has this annoying wire that hits you when you touch it. Really Inside the Claw Machine is an entirely different and more confusing maze. Nightmare Buzz moves slowly. And the list goes on. Things are still easier after beating it once, though. The storyline is horribly written in the game. For example: \"I'm so mad that I can't see where I'm going!\" However, you'd just skip the storyline cutscenes anyway. What? We've all done it. But overall, this is a good game for the Genesis library that you should probably own.

It has the same addicting traffic-dodging gameplay that put Konami/Sega (Though Konami won in a legal battle) on the map and, while it doesn't have the same graphics as the original, it provides its own colorful graphics. You would think that it would probably be better than the original, but no. What sucks about this version is that it doesn't have the catchy music from the original. In fact, it doesn't have ANY music. Just wonky sound effects. Also, since the game has been revamped with updated graphics, the wonky sound effects, and no music, it just loses the charm that struck me as I played the arcade game.</td><td>Better graphics does not make a better game</td><td>1307664000</td><td>0</td><td>157</td><td>754</td><td>8</td><td>4.802547770700637</td><td>19.625</td><td>0.08509524</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>10221</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>08 20, 2014</td><td>B00002SWBG</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Funnily enough, I never actually watched the Lion King movie so I don't really understand the many references we see in this video game.  However I know enough about it due to seeing it so many times in commercials, magazines and posters that I have a very good idea what it's like.  I also clearly remember my classmates loved this movie and it was VERY popular for at least a few months, and was actually the talk of the town in my school.  I also remember Elton John had a resurgence in popularity with classics such as \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight?\" and \"Circle of Life\" which dominated the radio airwaves. Seeing as how I love Elton John's music and think very highly of Disney movies, it's unfortunate I had some kind of bitter resentment towards the Lion King's popularity which is the reason I never sat down and watched it.  I will make an effort to actually watch the movie whenever I can.  I mean it!  I shouldn't hold resentment over a *movie* for crying out loud, especially one that's supposed to bring joy and adventure into our lives.  Perhaps I was jealous that all the kids were into the same things and I wanted to separate myself from the bunch.  I used to be rebellious as a kid.  Rebellious against not only teachers and my parents, but other classmates.  That's true rebellion! Anyway let's get into the review.  Something about basing video games off Disney movies in the early to mid 90's really brought out the graphical power of the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis.  The Lion King is no exception.  Just LOOK at how beautiful and crisp the animations, graphics and sound are.  I think the Super NES version is slightly superior over the Genesis version simply because the graphics are slightly more colorful, the backgrounds richer, the sprites of the two lions Mufasa and Simba are livelier (and by the way, they're both playable in the game but you can't select which one you want to play as which is the only flaw I can find), the music is MUCH better due to resembling actual African rhythms and beats, and the Super NES version is more polished overall.  The Super NES even features more sound effects. Through lush jungles and waterfalls, mountain terrains and fire-drenched underground areas, you have to guide Mufasa and Simba to the top of the mountain in 6 or 7 different stages while mainly climbing rocky platforms the entire way.  Mufasa and Simba have several moves to defend themselves against the enemy danger such as the ability to claw-punch, jumping on top of enemies and a certain flip move to toss enemies over your head which is necessary to complete the game.  On a side note I love the realistic looking animation we see of the lions holding onto the side and climbing platforms.  Really neat.  Their facial expressions are believable too which is why I recommend standing them still for a moment so you can admire them.  The animation is seriously magnificent throughout this game. The challenge is fairly high overall because even regular enemies are no pushovers and require a fair bit of clever thinking to take care of them, but nothing you can't handle with patience.  The 3rd person view where you're running towards the TV screen swerving left to right and avoiding wild animals charging from behind while having to jump over rocks ahead is a VERY hard but brief segment, as is a certain log climbing part involving a waterfall.  Seriously, why can't the logs be positioned the LONG (lengthy) way instead of the narrow opposite way?  Would make the jumps so much more bearable.  The final level is a mountainous cave puzzle level which can be quite difficult and confusing with animal danger everywhere. But yeah, the animations are really wonderful.  The enemies themselves breathe amazing life into the game due to their movements.  Everything about this game looks way ahead of its time.  It's comparable to the Genesis version of Aladdin in that the graphics and animations are top-notch and just gorgeous.  Whereas Genesis gets the better version of Aladdin, the Super NES gets the better version of the Lion King.  Highly recommended platforming fun.</td><td>really cool game</td><td>1408492800</td><td>0</td><td>740</td><td>3376</td><td>33</td><td>4.562162162162162</td><td>22.424242424242426</td><td>0.16172267</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>10235</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>02 4, 2004</td><td>B00002SVML</td><td>Bryan</td><td>I don't get the appeal of the Wipeout games. They're terrible. Wipeout 3 and XL are no different. The music is good enough (for a bunch of techno beats... yeah, I'm not a techno fan) and the graphics are slick and futuristic-looking, but the actual racing part has one BIG problem: you keep hitting the side of the track as you go around a turn and for some reason that means you have to make a complete stop. It wouldn't be so bad if you just slowed down, but the fact that your vehicle stops *immediately* is the worst thing ever. How are you supposed to enjoy a racing game if you keep hitting the side of the track and STOPPING every couple seconds? There's so many turns in any one of the races, that the problem is unavoidable. I don't understand when people say you need skill to enjoy these racing games. If I can't increase speed, then what ELSE is there to enjoy? If the appeal lies in playing each race over and over so you can memorize the track to avoid hitting the side, then count me out. Doing that would be WAY too tedious of a task. You need a lot of space to freely drive around or else a racing game won't work. Sure, I can go around shooting other vehicles, but who cares about that when I can't ever catch up to them. Too many sharp turns in the Wipeout series make it difficult to build up speed. Right when I think I've got a good race going, I hit the side and my car stops and there goes the momentum. What a way to kill the fun.

But anyone who has played Gunstar Heroes knows that it's possibly the best run and gun ever made for the home console.  It's intense, the action never stops and it impliments some unique gameplay elements that make the game a lot of fun to play.  Also, unlike Contra, the game isn't insanely hard, but has a really balanced difficulty level.  Nintendo was gracious enough to put this on the Virtual Console, so even if you don't have a Genesis, you can still download it for 800 Wii points (eight bucks), and you don't need a Classic Controller to play it. As I mentioned, Gunstar Heroes is a brilliantly crafted game.  It's crisp and clean looking, perhaps one of the best looking Genesis games out there.  You start off by choosing one of two characters, and one of four weapons.  You can either choose a character that lets you run while your shooting, or one that stands still and shoots.  They both have their advantages and disadvantages, such as you constantly running off a cliff if you decide not to choose the fixed character.  But if you choose the fixed character and the level scrolls... oh boy.  The game is also two player, and you're not restricted to just playing as one or the other.  You can both be the free-moving character if you want. The weapons range from a plain ordinary shot, a homing shot, lightning and a flamethrower.  What's more interesting is that you can carry two different weapons at a time and switch between them.  Even MORE interesting, is that you can combine two weapons and see what you get.  You could, for example, have a homing lightning shot.  This element just opens up a ton of possibilities. As you run through the levels, the game is certainly not shy about throwing enemies at you.  This is one of the most intense shooters around.  Enemies are literally coming from every corner, and surprisingly, there's never a drop in framerate.  With how decorative these environments are and things exploding every two or three seconds as well as enemies littering the screen, you'd expect there to be some slow down, there is none and the game itself moves pretty fast only adding to the intensity.  It makes the game that much more fun. Gunstar Heroes is a treat.  If you don't have Gunstar Heroes and you have a Genesis (or Wii) then you owe it to yourself to get this game.  You'll have a lot of fun with it, and it has excellent replay value. NOTE TO WII VIRTUAL CONSOLE USERS: The game supports the Wii Remote, and it works just fine.

Bearing resemblance to Konami's Contra games and other \"run 'n gun\" type games, the gameplay is pretty basic.  You run around with automatic firing weapons blowing away the hordes and hordes of enemies that get into your way.  You'll find plenty of different power ups that quickly change the pace of the game, but the two player mode is where the real fun of Gunstar Heroes is to be had.  For back in it's day, the graphics were great, and today they still hold up for a 2-D side scroller shooter.  Controls are incredibly easy and you know what to do from the minute you pop in the cartridge and play.  The sound and music is the game's only lowpoint, but most of that can be blamed on the Genesis' poor soundchip (remember, this system was known for having shabby sound).  All in all though, Gunstar Heroes is still one of the greatest action games of all time, and if you still have a Genesis and don't have this game, you should do all you can to track it down.</td><td>The best game to ever grace the Genesis</td><td>1070582400</td><td>1</td><td>216</td><td>917</td><td>9</td><td>4.24537037037037</td><td>24.0</td><td>0.17944445</td><td>805</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>10257</td><td>5.0</td><td>29</td><td>false</td><td>01 25, 2004</td><td>B00002SVG0</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Ladies and gentlemen, this is IT!!!  The ultimate Mario game!  The *ultimate* video game PERIOD! There is *so* much to do in Yoshi's Island, whether it's collecting flowers, stars and red coins in an attempt to aim for a perfect score, or the mini games flooded through each of the six massive worlds (such as roulette, card match and slot machines to name a few) this is, without a doubt, the most exciting Mario game ever. Thought Super Mario World was big, didn't you?  That game looks microscopic compared to Yoshi's Island.  As I mention above, trying to get a 100% score in every level is a MAJOR reason the game is so much fun, because you have a reason to replay Yoshi's Island over and over.  In some levels you may be left wandering around for a long time until you find all the red coins, flowers and stars.  If you ask me, any one of the levels in Yoshi's Island is TWICE as long as the ones in Super Mario World, and probably three or four times bigger than the ones in Super Mario Bros. 3.  Nintendo really went out of their way to bring Mario fans the biggest adventure yet, and the funny thing about the game is how it didn't receive as much attention as you'd expect when it hit stores in 1995. The levels in this game are positively PACKED with TONS of goodies.  Flowers, stars, coins, 1-up's, enemies, P-switches, you name it.  The thing that amazes me is that 10 years after owning the game, I'm STILL finding more of those invisible floating clouds (usually containing stars inside).  There must be THOUSANDS of those babies! Speaking of babies... CRY CRY CRY!!!  Yeah, Mario is PRETTY darn annoying but you have to remember he's just a baby!  YOU were crying like that, too!  You have to forgive him.  Cuddle him and be thankful YOU don't have to raise this child! The only problem is that the music could have been better.  It's not bad, I mean, it SOUNDS really good, but most of the themes don't really impress me.  They're still pretty catchy (you will remember them after you turn off the game) but... I don't know.  Just not the kind of music you'd expect to hear in a Mario game.  It's like Nintendo wanted to progress the typical Mario themes into something bigger.  Actually, the music is like a soundtrack to a children's book. The challenge is excellent (which means \"just right\").  One of the hardest Mario games to date- you will be playing this game for a long, long time.  Trust me, you'll WANT to dig in and replay this bad boy over and over because of the amount of fun it offers.  The challenge isn't in reaching the end of the level.  It's in trying to get a score of 100% in every level. Yoshi was just starting out in the original Super Mario World and Nintendo weren't entirely sure what kind of things they wanted to do with him.  Look how much Yoshi has improved in this game!  You can jump on enemies, stomp on enemies, spit enemies at other enemies, turn enemies into eggs, and shoot eggs with a sliding target thing (it's hard to explain but it will make perfect sense once you see it).  You can also aim your tongue upward, reaching for things above you (including baby Mario when he floats away).  You control Yoshi throughout the game which explains all the new things he can do. This game is just incredible.  Please pick it up.  You won't regret it!  I've played Yoshi's Island a lot and, thanks to TONS of practice, I've become pretty good at it (I STILL can't get 100% in every level though, but that's a pretty difficult task).  I have to say the final boss battle with Bowser simply blows my mind.  I simply LOVE shooting eggs at him while having to jump around on tiny rocks.  A fantastic battle. Also, a reviewer below named linda mccormick says you need some kind of special equipment to play Yoshi's Island.  That's not true.  Just a regular controller will work.  She may have meant the Nintendo 64 Yoshi game, or a different game entirely.</td><td>video game brilliance</td><td>1074988800</td><td>1</td><td>746</td><td>3156</td><td>43</td><td>4.230563002680965</td><td>17.348837209302324</td><td>0.06259193</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>10313</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>11 20, 2010</td><td>B00002SWCO</td><td>Ryan Sil.

The sounds are taken straight from the arcade game. The graphics are actually made more detailed than how the arcade game's graphics are. Now, for the gameplay, there's a lot to talk about. Right after the title screen, there's tons of options to choose from: -Players: 1, 2 (Co-op), 2 (Competitive), 2 (Alternative) -Difficulty: Easy, Normal, Hard, Crazy -Pac-Booster: On, off (I ALWAYS choose On for this one. What can beat fast Ms. Pac-Man?) -Maze Selection (My favorite option): Arcade, Mini, Big, Strange You can alter the game with all of those options! The main gameplay is pure Ms. Pac-Man awesomeness.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>1995 seemed to be a great year for a gamer. The Donkey Kong Country series went portable with DK Land, Rayman was a surprise full of perfection, and Vectorman appealed to Sega Genesis players with its colorful pre-rendered graphics that DKC had done. All of these games were great, but Yoshi's Island was the best of all. While Rayman would have been my favorite game of all time, it suffered from the most extreme difficulty EVER. Yoshi's Island has amazing graphics, catchy sound/music, awesome gameplay, AND forgiving difficulty alike. This is not the average Mario game, but rather is it what fans would call a Yoshi game, since it plays a lot differently. As Yoshi, you romp through levels like usual, but now you can throw eggs at enemies, as well as eat enemies to make eggs. There is also a huge variety of obstacles, like boulders, loads of unique platforms, collectible flowers, the enemies doing all kinds of stuff, etc, etc. But the thing is: It is all well-crafted and carefully put together for one of the ultimate platforming experiences. Don't believe me? Go on some video websites and watch some gameplay footage. One look and you'll agree that it looks beyond terrific. There are also some bonuses in the game to help you on your quest to defeat the evil Bowser Jr. For example, there are small houses that you may possibly find in a level (It requires a key, though). Once you are able to enter in, you must compete with an enemy in a certain challenge (Collect most coins, Pop most balloons, etc). There's also bonus challenges when the goal chooses a flower you had collected (In a roulette-like way). Overall, it's definitely one of the greatest platformers I have ever played. I may prefer Super Mario World as the best of all, but this game certainly comes close to winning that title.</td><td>One of the greatest platformers of all time</td><td>1331596800</td><td>1</td><td>317</td><td>1491</td><td>18</td><td>4.703470031545741</td><td>17.61111111111111</td><td>0.17404762</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>10387</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>true</td><td>01 25, 2011</td><td>B00002SVF6</td><td>Ryan Sil. (Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>As any Capcom guy would know, MegaMan is the hardest game series the company had ever created. Ever since the original NES version, it was hard. But it was still a great game. The Game Boy version, released after the NES sequel, was no exception. The Game Boy's smaller screen caused some slight changes to the formula. For example, MegaMan seems to have slightly less HP than in the NES games. However, there's less in the game's layout, too. So it kinda evens out. The sounds and music are also sounding different. Well, the music is carried over from MegaMan on the NES, but different 8-Bit instruments are used. Some sound effects are totally different, such as the Mega Buster sounds. The game has 4 robot masters compared to the NES game's 6. Even though the game is easier than the NES games, it's still pretty hard for people that aren't hardcore MegaMan fans. If you are one of those people, it'll take a while to get past all the robot masters and reach Dr. Wily. The precise controls, the tricky pathways, and difficult situations are all present. Fortunately, once you reach a robot master, it's possible you may beat him right away, or you lose a life or two and THEN beat him. The downside to the bosses is the weaknesses. They are off. For example, when I tried fighting Iceman, I used Fireman's power (Reasonable, right?), but it didn't do a whole lot of damage. Then I tried Elecman's power, and it took him out in 3 or 4 hits. (Edit: Never mind. This isn't actually an error.) In Dr. Wily's stage, things are just plain unforgiving the first time you play through it (Thank god for Passwords). There will be spikes in places you least expect, traps that seal you to your doom, etc. Also, before you fight Dr. Wily, you must battle 4 MORE robots from MegaMan 2 (NES game)! Be sure to get your powers ready, because you're in for a short marathon. But after this, you go through one last level. Then, you reach Dr. Wily at last, who is actually pretty easy once you get this pattern down: Use Quickman's power to shoot off the his robot's mouth, and then use the Energy Buster to reflect Wily's lasers, while avoiding a robo-claw that reaches for you. All of these events are packed into 6 levels of run 'n gun fun. Yeah, it's possible you can beat this game in 20-30 minutes, but at least you will have fun doing it. Overall, this is a really great game for the classic Game Boy. If you have a Game Boy, a Game Boy Color, or even a Game Boy Advance, itching for some classic MegaMan action, this is the game for you. If you are new to MegaMan, this should be a good place to start (Other than the Game Boy sequel, MegaMan II).</td><td>Smaller screen?

As the years go by, Final Fantasy Tactics is one of the few games where reception of the game has increased over the years rather than decrease.  Despite having a reissue on the PSP, the original game is still a treat.  However, both versions have their own cons.  While many have reported that the PSP version has slowdown, the original Playstation release suffers from a mediocre translation of a fantastic story. Final Fantasy Tactics concerns itself with Ramza Beoulve.  A noble who believes in justice and honor.  In the world of Ivalice, Ramza is about to be involved in the biggest power struggle in the world's history.  It concerns a conspiracy bigger than anything Ramza could imagine.  The story is full of almost everything you can imagine.  Betrayal, injustice and some of the most mature themes Final Fantasy has ever dared to go to.  Be forewarned, though.  Despite a T-Rating, the game is actually quite dark.  Despite it's cutesy graphics this game is anything but cute as it is easily the most violent and moving of all the Final Fantasy games. The gameplay that makes Final Fantasy Tactics a treat. Thanks to the job system, customization is nearly endless. Before each battle you can assign jobs to your characters. Each job has specific traits about them and can greatly affect how you perform in battle. Mages have devastating magic abilities while Knights are strong physical attackers. They also bring their own unique abilities to the table. Because there are so many job classes to choose from, there's a lot of experimentation you can do. As you master abilities you'll also be able to mix and match. You could have a Squire casting white magic, for example provided you've learned some of the white magic abilities. As battles progress you gain experience. You pretty much gain experience after each and every turn, which is nice. Not only do you gain experience but you also gain job points to help you master the abilities in your job class. It's pretty simple stuff and you'll be surprised at just how fast you can learn abilities here. However, Final Fantasy Tactics was notorious for being an incredibly challenging game.  In order to survive some of the games toughest battles you'll have to spend hours roaming around to learn abilities and raise levels.  Enemies don't let up and they actually are quite smart.  They'll take advantage of your parties disadvantages by usually attacking the weakest character or even ganging up on certain characters.  It's also no help that their attacks deal a startling large amount of damage.  If you want to survive in Final Fantasy Tactics, level grinding is a must and it's not negotiable. In terms of graphics, Final Fantasy Tactics is fairly cute looking.  But the sprites are incredibly detailed, especially for 1998.  Unlike the PSP version the game also runs smoothly and fast.  There are also a few cutscenes here and there to show you some of the story.  Tactics also sports some of the best music the series has ever known. If there was anything to criticize about the original release it would be the same thing that everyone criticizes.  The translation is absolutely horrible.  The story is incredible, but the script for the original Playstation version may be one of the worst efforts done in localization history.  It's almost worth it to pick up the PSP version of the game for this one reason alone.  Some of the translation is so bad some parts of the story are utterly confusing.  The only other problem with Final Fantasy Tactics is that if you really want to get through the game, you'll spend the least amount of time taking in the story.  As I mentioned earlier, level grinding is a must to survive throughout the adventure.  The problem is you'll have to do it too much.  To the point where it stops the advancement of the story.  Sometimes for long intervals at a time.  And the story hardly retreads or reiterates events. Final Fantasy Tactics is easily one of the best games in the series.  It is not, however, for the beginner or the inexperienced Tactical Strategy game player.  For those who don't wimp out, however, Final Fantasy Tactics is rewarding.</td><td>Arguably One of the Greatest Final Fantasy Games Ever Made</td><td>1203897600</td><td>1</td><td>785</td><td>3627</td><td>53</td><td>4.620382165605095</td><td>14.81132075471698</td><td>0.09869047</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>10449</td><td>5.0</td><td>10</td><td>false</td><td>06 20, 2003</td><td>B00002SVWG</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Final Fantasy Tactics is a classic game for the Playstation which is still great fun to play in the days of the Playstation 2. The graphics are reasonably good, with three dimensional characters and environments. The church you start out near, for examples, looks like one you might construct out of paper and color the walls of. Very flat with few surfaces, but relatively reasonable for the time. Gameplay involes you and your group of up to 7 friends trying to figure out a war between two halves of the country you're in. Each character has its own strengths and weaknesses, of course, and they gain in skill as they go through battles. Battle is turn based and involves your 3D characters and your enemies on a map. You have to move close to your enemies to fight with them, and figure out who to move in close and who to keep further off. This is different than the Final Fantasy RPG series where in essence your team stands in a line, the enemy stands in a line, and you simply fire at each other. There are of course chocobos, your yellow friends that can carry you around. In this version, they can even lay eggs! You never know what will hatch out of one, and it's a neat way to add new monsters to your group. I will comment that the translations are pretty awful, the letters appear S - L - O - W - L - Y on the screen and the plot is rather complex with names and alliances to keep track of. But that's a minor flaw given how fun the game is. Highly recommended to any Final Fantasy fan, even though it's a bit old.

Pokemon Pinball isn't even the first! But you know what? The folks at Jupiter still figured out how to make the theme work. The Pokeball is your ball, and several Pokemon play roles of obstacles. You know the drill: Use the flippers to knock the ball around the table to score as much as you can by having your (Poke)ball knock into things or other Pokemon. The physics might not be totally accurate, but it's not easy to notice. In fact, I think the pinball feel is pretty unique, thanks to the Rumble feature the game borrows from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/the-Nintendo-64-s-Rumble-Pak/dp/B00004S9AA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">the Nintendo 64's Rumble Pak</a>. You can really feel the action going on, and surprisingly, I can't think of another pinball game that does this.

True to the franchise, there's the original 151 Pokemon lurking around at certain times in the game. You first lure one in by scoring, yeah, but in the end, you're on a mission to fill out the entire Pokedex with entries of each Pokemon your capture!

Not to mention the most addicting. Well, Dino Crisis 2 is probably the most addicting, but this game comes next. As I surf around the internet reading peoples opinions and thoughts on video games, I like to search for reviews from people who reviewed innovative games back in the day, and compare those reviews to the most recent ones to see if the general opinion has changed any, as the years went by. Sometimes a game that seemed unstoppable back in the day won't be remembered today, such as Earthworm Jim. With Resident Evil 2, opinions have remained extremely positive all these years later. People are *still* talking about Resident Evil 2 today, in 2007. Why? What IS it about Resident Evil 2 that makes people keep coming back for more? Could it be an addiction to shooting zombies over and over? That may be it, because, despite the fact that zombies walk slowly and predictably through each area of the game you explore, something about wanting to keep killing them *never* gets boring. Maybe it's hearing that \"pop\" sound from the handgun and watching a zombie bleed and take a step back to gather their brain dead thoughts that makes the game so memorable? These zombies are actually pretty animated when you consider the age this game was released (1997-1998). Sometimes you walk into a room and a zombie will be walking the other way, you shoot, and it will slowly turn around and come after you. This is pretty cool. It means they're not entirely stupid. They know when someone is trying to kill them again. You can literally blow zombies in half with a single shotgun blast! To add even more creativity to the game, Capcom allowed the top-half of their bodies to CRAWL after you after they've been blown in half. Sometimes, only two or three handgun shots will kill a zombie off, while other times it might take up to eight or nine shots to kill one. It's all part of the mystery and uncertainty that makes shooting these bad boys so much fun. Other times, zombies will trick you into thinking they're dead, only to grab around your ankle when you try walking past them. You really have to make sure you finished them off before heading towards the next part of the police station. Otherwise, they will be back when you return. Or at the very least, make sure you walk around them *completely* when they're laying on the ground, and don't come near them. I won't spoil anything, but using a magnum bullet on a zombie will give you the ultimate satisfaction. I guarantee it! There's no telling what will happen. Zombies will simply continue walking up to you until a puddle of blood forms on the ground, confirming they're finally dead. I like the added special touch of having zombies dressed in a police uniform, in addition to having female zombies walk up to you and attack. You don't want to hurt a female zombie but, you know, it's either you or her that dies. Decide! What else makes Resident Evil 2 still *very* addicting 10 years later? Maybe it's the multiple storylines and all the quests? You see, the game is 2 discs long, and each disc contains two different quests. To get the ultimate experience out of Resident Evil 2, you need to beat all four quests, twice with the female character (named Claire) and twice with the male character (Leon). Each one of these four adventures has zombies and items appearing in different locations, giving the game a ton of replay value. Of course, most of the replay value is found in just shooting zombies left and right. This is very addicting, trust me. You will love killing them over and over. Besides zombies, giant spiders, vicious dogs, and these disgusting creatures called \"lickers\" also occupy the police station. I'd say lickers are definitely the most complicated enemy to deal with because they have a habit of leaping at you with their claw hanging forward, and stabbing you. I love when you enter a room and you can't see a licker, but you can definitely hear them. You might hear a ticking sound or a very deep breathing sound to alert you a licker is around somewhere. I can't put into words how disturbingly Exorcist-like this game can be. To save your game, you need to put an ink ribbon into a typewriter. Each ink ribbon you find actually holds two of them, so you can save your game twice when you find one of these. Most ink ribbons are found in the same room as the typewriter, but others can be hidden in rooms where no typewriter is found. You don't need to find ALL of them in order to beat the game, but it would certainly help you out in the long run if you store as many ink ribbons are you can. You never know when it might be a good time to save. Bullets are plentiful. Handgun bullets, especially. They're everywhere on easy mode. So are shotgun bullets, however, make sure you save as many shotgun bullets are you can because towards the end of the game, when enemies get meaner and angrier, they will come in handy. You don't want to come face to face with three angry lickers and only have handgun bullets with you, believe me. Also, the magnum (which is found in the beginning of the game) is the ultimate weapon. Of course, shotguns and magnums are only available for the Leon quest. In Claire's quest, you have something called Acid Rounds and a Bow Gun, which are equally as dangerous. They do tremendous damage to enemies, which means it would be wise to save them until the end of the game. To heal yourself, you need to collect green herbs that are laying throughout the police station, and white spray bottles (which heal you completely). They are everywhere in the game, which means, on easy mode NONE of the four quests are really that hard. Just don't go around shooting everything you see and you should have no problem finishing the game. The graphics are dated now, obviously, but back in 1998 we've never SEEN anything like this before. Outside on the streets is nighttime, and the lights in the police station are dim and just as scary and fitting. It's hard to believe how real the atmosphere is. The only negative is that the music isn't quite as good as you've probably read. Neither are the sound effects (except for the sounds those lickers make). Silent Hill has the game beat in this area. The only problem is that each of the four quests are between 2 and 2 and a half hours long. By todays standards, that's incredibly short. However, if you add up the play time for all four quests, you're looking at a good 10 hours of zombie-shootin'. Honestly, you're supposed to go through the four quests to get everything out of Resident Evil 2 (something I didn't realize until a year after I bought it). Saying this game is groundbreaking isn't really enough. Resident Evil 2 opened peoples eyes about the mystery and fascination of zombies, and how frightening they can be. Capcom showed people how zombies walking around moaning and spitting can catch your attention and frighten you. The zombies shown in movies aren't nearly as scary as the ones in this game, in my opinion. Zombie movies are laughable, almost like comedy movies. In a video game, it's a more serious and terrifying situation. Not to mention much bloodier in video game form. I'm sure you can find me an example of a scary zombie movie, but I haven't seen one yet. It should also be noted that the Playstation One had a bunch of similar zombie games available when the console was popular, but almost every one of them went by unnoticed. The Resident Evil series was simply too popular and fun for any imitations to catch on and gain success. Then again, I haven't really played any of the games that supposedly rip off the RE series, so they might be worth playing as far as I know. Resident Evil 2 also helped the whole \"survival horror\" genre gain major popularity. Before this game, the genre didn't really have a proper name. We just called them \"scary games\" or whatever. Also, the play control in this game was excellent, not to mention important in helping people understand how to control characters in a 3D world. The Resident Evil series might not allow a lot of room to walk around, but I don't think it's supposed to. You're supposed to get a sense of claustrophobia. You spend the majority of the time in tight hallways and small rooms. Resident Evil 2 stands proud today as a major achievement in the world of video games and a game people will probably never forget. Owning it will do you some good.</td><td>you can't handle the constant fear</td><td>1174262400</td><td>0</td><td>1528</td><td>6994</td><td>84</td><td>4.577225130890052</td><td>18.19047619047619</td><td>-0.0463726</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>10724</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>01 11, 2012</td><td>B000035XB0</td><td>Ryan Sil.

And now that it's 3DS e-Shop re-release is available on Club Nintendo for only 100 coins (If you don't know about Club Nintendo, I suggest you join and see what it's about. It's a great service), I was able to go and nab this classic at ease. So, Kirby is known as a pink blob that sucks things up and copies enemy abilities, right? Well, here, since it IS the first Kirby game, you don't get to obtain enemy powers whatsoever. You'll be happy to know, however, that it doesn't affect the platforming experience badly at all. In fact, Kirby's Dream Land as a whole is spectacular. The graphics are some of the best I've ever seen on a Game Boy game, and the music is very upbeat and fun to listen to. To top it all off, the gameplay is thrilling. It's unlike what you've dealt with in other Nintendo classics like Mario. Not only do you run and jump, but you can eat enemies, and spit them out at others! Oh, and you can fly! There are also some cool gimmicks, like shooting fire after collecting SuperSpicey Curry for a short period of time, and being able to fly and shoot out puff clouds during one of the bosses, in a similar fashion to shooters like Gradius. The only issue with this game is that it is pretty short. There are only 5 levels, with the 5th level being composed of bosses that you've previously fought, as well as King Dedede, the final boss. But just because a game is short doesn't mean it's bad. And this game is excellent. Unlike Kirby 64 and Kirby's Dream Land 3, this game is not totally easy, as there's surprisingly a bit of challenge here. Plus, the music sounds best here. Anyways, if you happen to own a Game Boy, a GB Color, or a GB Advance, this is definitely one game to play. Heck, you should buy it on the e-Shop for your Nintendo 3DS (If you own one), or go to Club Nintendo and get this without using actual money (Though this offer will last until the 31st)!</td><td>Kirby's terrific debut</td><td>1326240000</td><td>0</td><td>381</td><td>1621</td><td>18</td><td>4.254593175853018</td><td>21.166666666666668</td><td>0.119759776</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>10761</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>11 22, 2010</td><td>B000035XKJ</td><td>Ryan Sil.

Who would have guessed Castlevania Bloodlines is actually in my opinion at least, one of the finest Genesis games ever and easily one of the best Castlevania games ever?  I'm totally not kidding with you guys!  Talk about getting the surprise of my life tonight.  This game does a LOT of things right.  In fact it does just about *every* thing right.  It's better than all the NES Castlevania games which isn't easy for me to say considering how much I love Castlevania III in particular, and it's leagues better than the Super NES game Bloodlines is constantly compared to for unfair reasons (Dracula X).  Dare I go to the extreme and say it's possibly even a notch better than Super Castlevania IV?  Oh yeah, it just might be!  I'll tell you exactly why Bloodlines is a masterpiece below. Well you're given a choice between two characters to take you through the journey- the whip swinging John Morris or the axe swinging Eric Lecarde.  At first I thought the axe was clunky and awkward but I warmed up to it after a few minutes.  Still, I prefer the traditional whip so John Morris is my choice for favorite character of the two.  So what makes Bloodlines so good?  The atmosphere and the appropriately dark graphics/setting make this game skyrocket to new levels of awesomeness.  Maybe it's unintentional that the gritty graphics enhance the experience much like it does for the original Silent Hill on the Playstation to name an example, but WOW am I really impressed with the level of creepiness and fear while playing this game!  And it's all because the setting, graphics and atmosphere is spot-on.  ALL Castlevania games are supposed to present this kind of creepy tone!  Why don't they?  Why is it that Bloodlines is honestly the only Castlevania that truly gives me the creeps?  Well whether Konami intended Bloodlines to be so creepy or not doesn't change the fact it's effectively well done. The most memorable stage is, if memory serves, the end of stage 3 where first you have to climb a blue building that uniquely shakes back and forth avoiding medusa heads, and a couple screens after this the atmosphere kicks in even stronger where you have to travel up a really big staircase outside avoiding demon bird creatures.  This is the best moment in the history of Castlevania!  I felt scared to continue forward!  Even the music kept me excited here.  Did I forget to mention how detailed and animated the bosses are?  They're also HUGE!  How could I forget!  Lots of variety, and guess what?  This game seems to specialize in boss fights above everything else not just in fantastic detail but the amount of them you'll face throughout the game.  The levels themselves are almost an afterthought in comparison.  Besides Dracula, Death and the really tall Frankenstein, there's also several other cool looking bosses.  The one made of gears is the most creative.  Expect several boss fights along the way. Absolutely awesome!  I can't even think of another word to say right now.  Wait, one more thing.  The clarity of the animations and a commendable attempt at a more sophisticated musical score makes me think Bloodlines was an influence for the legendary Symphony of the Night that would be released a few years later.  The credits theme is absolutely *brilliant* in both emotion and effectiveness too especially since you're able to see the bosses scrolling along the screen.  While Dracula X may have the most spectacular backgrounds and music, the problem with that game is that it's too safe and doesn't take chances like this game does.  Is Bloodlines better than Super Castlevania IV?  I honestly think it's a notch better but it's *really* close.  Bloodlines is simply the best Castlevania game of the 8-bit and 16-bit generation of gaming but I KNOW a lot of people think Super Castlevania IV takes the cake, and I certainly won't argue with anyone who prefers SCIV since that game is amazing too.

The home ports for the Super Nintendo and the Genesis are compatible with the Super Scope and the Sega Menacer game guns. However, you may also use the controllers, but the result of that is moving a cursor around shooting things. It isn't a bad way to play, though. The game tries to follow the movie's storyline by telling it in between certain levels. After waiting for the first part of the story to end, you will end up shooting everything in sight! There are robots coming from both sides of the screen, and enemy planes flying in the sky. Kill them all!! That sums up the whole game pretty much, but the awesome action would obviously keep you playing. One downside I must point out is that the level where you have to protect John Konner is too difficult. There are several robots and planes attacking the pickup truck. However, there is a way I know to beat this level: Only bomb the planes. Don't concentrate on the robots. And bomb them RIGHT AWAY! Having another player help out would be nice, I guess. Thankfully, there's a 2-Player mode that adds to the game's replay value.

Looking like a bastard offspring of Earthbound for the Super Nintendo, Contact offers some nice dungeon type areas, quirky characters, and nice side quests, but the rest of it feels as if we've seen all this before, and seen it done better to boot.  What really hurts Contact is the incredibly boring and repetitive combat, in which each side trades hits until one goes down.  The combat alone makes Contact suffer, not to mention the bland graphics, tacked on touch screen controls and features, and a surprisingly short main quest for an RPG.  There's some Wi-Fi capabilities as well, allowing you to obtain some special items via trades with other players, and that's about all that Contact has to offer.  The game has a unique charm to it, and it's not necessarily a hard game to get into, but there's nothing here that brings it to the level of say, Final Fantasy III.

X-Men manages to catch the spirit of the comic  allowing you play as Wolverine, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, and Gambit while getting assistance from Iceman, Storm, Rogue, Archangel, and Jean Grey.  You go through a number of huge levels, ranging from the Savage Land to a Shi'ar ship to Excalibur's castle to a ravaged Sentinel filled future to Asteroid M where you confront Magneto.  You are thrown against hordes of generic looking enemies, but X-Men is surprisingly difficult and features some great boss battles (including Juggernaut, Deathbird, Sabretooth, Ahab, and finally Magneto among others) and the game effectively uses each character's different mutant powers such as Wolvie's berserker attack and Gambit's kinetic laced cards.  The graphics are sharp, colorful, and surprisingly full of detail, while the controls are easy enough to pick up.

I always loved my Genesis and I still play it to this day, but the one thing that always ticked me off was how the Super Nintendo always got more coverage than the Genesis did.  True, the Genesis didn't have the color pallete or sound chip that the Super NES had, but the Genesis had a huge library of exclusive games that defined the 16-bit era.  Naturally as with every Sega system, the best games are the sports and fighting games, and the Genesis has tons of them.  Without a doubt the Genesis is a landmark system, and if you still have yours hang on to it.

I've heard, many many times, that the difficulty is the biggest reason this game is inferior to the first installment.  Yeah, that might be true (ok, I won't deny it- it's COMPLETELY true!) but there are some nice things about it. One, it's all about the action.  The action levels in the previous ActRaiser were fantastic, and the ones in this game are nearly as good, probably.  But then you quickly find out the difficulty has been turned up a few notches, and you wanna run away.  I honestly haven't played this game that much.  My dad's ex-girlfriend bought a Super NES one time, so me and her could go back and forth exchanging games, but the relationship between her and my dad was always kind of rocky, so not much exchanging occurred after all. Anyway, she bought ActRaiser II as her first purchase, unaware that the challenge of the game was set on extremely hard (even on easy) and it would STAY that way throughout the game, making you want to go crazy (giving you a feeling of NOT feeling good at ALL about yourself after completing a level, because you'd know the next level would be JUST as hard, or even HARDER!)  People who are able to go through this game without cheating, and defeat the final boss- you're the best!  Actually, maybe if you practice one level over and over and finally beat it, you WOULD feel good about it.  But then the next level comes along and SMACK, back down to getting your butt kicked again! Hey,  I wasn't aware of the challenge either, until I got the internet.  HARD game here folks.  HARD!  Definitely not a good game to recommend to someone just learning to play video games!  Also not a good game for someone who gives up easily (like me!) I remember a certain theme song in this game that was incredibly warped the way it had a delicate and DARK, quiet melody.  I think it was the main map screen (if there even is one- I can't remember the game very well).  That was some damn intense music there, now.  I also remember the backgrounds of the levels had a very pretty appearance, and the detail was wonderful, which is what we've come to expect from a system as fantastic as the Super NES. As for the decision on the part of the game makers to remove the simulation part of the game: I don't have a problem with it.  It's not that big of a deal, if you ask me.  What drags the game down for me lies straight in the difficulty, and nothing else.  A good challenge is a nice way to start the day, but darn, not THIS kind of challenge!

There's nothing like dying a million times to make myself feel really dumb, only to come online to see many people actually think the game is simple!  I can't believe people think this game is easy. I can't even beat the game with a Game Genie infinite life cheat code!  I can only assume people who think this game is easy are comparing the difficulty to the more challenging Castlevania games on the NES or something.  If that's the case, you're right.  Those old NES Castlevania games truly test your patience!  At least in Super Castlevania IV I can manage to survive halfway through. Comparing Super Castlevania IV to other games on the Super NES like Zelda: Link to the Past or Mega Man X2, it's a really tough game.  Despite that, it's a pretty fun game and has a really good soundtrack.  You'll be humming along to the theme in the opening level, just you wait!

Granted, the Master System was out before it, but that didn't become a big shot console. The Genesis had a library of amazingly graphical 16-bit games before the Super Nintendo.

How can I explain what ActRaiser is like?  Honestly, I don't have ANY experience with simulation type games.  This is the only one I have ever played, and it's not even completely sim according to all the reviews!  It's only part sim! When I was a young kid and the Super NES was just released, I loved looking through the pictures in this one big gaming magazine I had, and seeing which games I wanted to buy.  This is one of the games I wanted, but for some reason, it took me 10 years to eventually get the chance to play it!  I guess this had to do with me losing interest in video games for a few years.  The spark has returned, though, so don't fear for I am BACK! Now, as I was saying, I didn't bother with ActRaiser when it was originally released.  The type of friends I had at the time didn't think simulation type video games were cool, and since back then friendship was so extremely important to me, I ignored the game.  A part of me really wanted to play this game in the early 90's, but damn it, peer pressure!  Maybe it was for the best, maybe not.  I can't go back in the past to find out if I'd made the right decision.  I probably wouldn't have liked the game back then anyway.  It took me until my early 20's to become open-minded to things I previously wrote off immediately, so I can only assume I would have shut down a simulation type game right away, in my childhood and teenage years.  My friends were pretty cool, despite this. I'm an adult now, and I'm finding out things about this game that I didn't know 15 years ago.  One such thing, as people frequently point out, this is one of, if not THE very first video game to mix simulation with side scroller/action gameplay.  Playing this game, it DOES feel like I'm playing something original, but I find it funny how people weren't aware of it back in 1991.  I can only guess because so many creative ideas were being thrown around back then in the world of video games, that an innovation of mixing sim with action was so small and insignificant at the time, and so people didn't care or didn't notice. People back then were too busy having fun and throwing parties for games like Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, and Zelda: Link to the Past (games that were REALLY groundbreaking) and people probably weren't paying much attention to ActRaiser's little unique features. But as I mention above, I haven't even bothered with any other sim-type game, so this is my first and only experience with this kind of genre.  The sim parts of this game (which cover about 6 different lands) feel extremely simple.  You are an angel, and you fly around shooting monsters and building towns.  The entire point of this part of the game is to create towns and destroy monster lairs with your arrows, so you can gain points and become stronger for the action part of the game.  You also talk to people along the way, and to be honest, sometimes it's an inconvenience because sometimes they have a LOT of information they want to give to you. But many times they give you items, important items, which can be used for either another area of the land during the town-building parts, or for the action parts of the game.  You'll eventually see that all the items the townspeople are giving to you can either be extremely helpful when fighting bosses, or extremely important for progressing to another part of the land. The music is interesting.  I think all the best music is featured during the action part of the game, and the music that plays during the simulation part of the game can get pretty boring after a while.  The bosses you will encounter are very fun to fight, and some of them are slightly challenging, but I have yet to come across a boss that was REALLY hard.  They all have a pattern, and the pattern you need to defeat them is usually something like finding a safe place to stand, waiting for the boss to come near you, and then slash away at him, until he's defeated.  But it's still fun because the bosses have cool attacks, and they look amazing.  Don't give up if you have trouble defeating a boss.  Sometimes it takes a few tries but eventually you should find the pattern, and once you find it, you will have no problem defeating them the next time you play the game. I especially love that boss where you are located on a series of ledges with a river behind you, and you have to face a giant flying snake.  I also love going through the volcano level. I should also mention that during the action part of the game you aren't the angel anymore.  I guess your character is God.  Sounds crazy, but I think it's true!  I really don't know.  My game didn't come with an instruction manuel.  Supposedly you can make the bosses even easier by using some kind of special magical move on them, but I haven't figured out how to do it yet.  I mean, I know it's the A button that delivers the special move (such as a fireball, in one instance) but you collect these special moves during the simulation part, and I can't figure out how to bring those moves to the action part of the game.  There's gotta be a way! Oh yeah, the music.  Back to the music.  If you like the music in this game check out the old rock band Genesis.  No, not the Genesis with Phil Collins as the lead singer, the Genesis of the early 70's with Peter Gabriel on vocals.  That band has music that reminds me of some of the level themes in this game.  Check out the Foxtrot or Nursery Cryme albums to see what I mean. This game sure makes me feel all magical inside.  Maybe it's the release of the new Harry Potter movie a few months ago that got me all excited to review this game, I don't know.  But according to many reviewers, this game is unique in the way it mixes two separate types of video games- simulation and action.  The sim areas all feel very simple to me, and that's probably the point.  The action part, while containing some rather tricky jumping movements (awkward play control!) is still the part I enjoy most. The graphics could have been better, but we can't complain about a game that came out in the beginning of the Super NES's successful run, now can we?

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>Mickey Mania was one of the last games Sony had created before the company went on to make the Playstation. The first level takes you to the iconic Steamboat Willie cartoon. However, if you think that the first level is supposed to be simple, think again. There are numerous obstacles that are most likely to hurt you. If you get hit, you are only invincible for half a second. What makes the gameplay become fun is when you start collecting these spheres and then later throw them at enemies. You soon encounter ol' timey Pete, but he actually isn't the boss. Hit him 4 times and use him as a spring to bounce over a pile of crates. The REAL first boss is the machinery. You must destroy 4 gears by hitting them 5 times (3 times for the top ones) The boss, at first, plays incredibly hard, since the crates drop bombs on you. However, you don't find out til later to figure out that you can just jump to avoid getting blown up. After the boss, Mickey appears with Steamboat Willie. Then the text says \"Congratulations! Mickey has rescued Steamboat Willie!\" What? He was kidnapped? The second level is, one of my favorites, The Mad Doctor. Right when you encounter a skeleton, things get hard. When the skeletons get destroyed, their bones fly up and fall down, but you actually had to avoid colliding with them. There are several portions of this level. After the first part, the second part contains rope swinging over lava. The third has you ride a runaway mine cart, but you must jump over the incoming spike balls. If things can't get any harder for you, you're lucky to know that the fourth portion lets you take a break as you run through a spiral staircase killing bats and jumping over barrels (Donkey Kong inspiration). It's easier than the previous parts...and it looks better than them, too, as that part is presented in fake 3D. There's also this part where you must perform chemistry. The downside here is that if you push it to the stool without the 3 layers you have to put in, the only decision is to kill yourself. The Mad Doctor doesn't seem like a very hard boss until you attack. If hit, he throws full flasks all over the place. The third level is Moose Hunters. If you don't follow Pluto on this one, you're dead. Countless tree branches and boulders would fall on you. Moose would also gallop towards you at certain times. After beating the first part, things get easier, yet awkward. You now have to run away from a moose in a beautifully stupid fake 3D level. The Lonesome Ghosts is your fourth level. Going up certain staircases would make them turn into a ramp. There are tilting platforms that you must tilt in the right direction to go on. The second part is annoying. You have to balance on a barrel while the house is being flooded. As you make your way towards left, the third barrel would sink, but if you get closer to the left, the water stops. That's the annoying part: The water. If you jump in, you lose your life automatically basically. Mickey and the Beanstalk is graphically colorful. There's not a lot of hard stuff in here. Although I must admit the dragonflies are annoying. When you get to the first huge enemy, you'd think it'd be a boss since boss music is playing, but no. You must hop on a ladybug. The ladybug speeds away from the \"boss\" extremely. Once you reach the giant's house, there's a plate with Jello on it. You have to push it towards the wall, but you probably won't know it at first, since it's a big object to push. Now...the Prince and the Pauper....it's the hardest and final level of the game. You swing, you kill, all that stuff. Unfortunately, I can't explain anymore since you must find about this on your own. Good luck. Overall, if you are a die-hard fan of platform games, Mickey Mouse, or you just want a major challenge, go ahead and buy this game.</td><td>A daring revisit through time</td><td>1290470400</td><td>1</td><td>698</td><td>3125</td><td>62</td><td>4.477077363896848</td><td>11.258064516129032</td><td>-0.0104897665</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>11091</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>10 30, 2006</td><td>B000035Y09</td><td>Bryan</td><td>I've never been able to enjoy the Final Fantasy series as much as most people.

Even when the game was popular the graphics never looked that great, in my opinion.  I don't know, everyone loves Final Fantasy and I guess I have no choice but to recommend it to any fan of RPGs.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>MegaMan has it all: Precise controls, catchy tunes, amazing graphics, and incredible gameplay. That has been spread across the 10 games in the classic console series, and the 5 games in the classic handheld series. So what is the deal with MegaMan II for the Game Boy? Well, it's supposed to be a version of MegaMan 2 for the NES. As the game starts, there are only 4 robot masters to encounter (Wood Man, Air Man, Crash Man, and Metal Man). This is because of cartridge limits, but when you play the first game on Game Boy and get to the Dr. Wily Teleport System, that part actually has you fight the other 4 robot masters from MegaMan 2. So what's in this game's Teleport System? Well, since this part is at the near-end of the game, I'll tell you further in this review. Anyways, the game is just as fun as all the other MegaMan games. The controls are still precise, the graphics are excellent, and the gameplay is spot-on. While it is supposed to be a version of MegaMan 2, however, the level layouts are different, and the music is nothing similar to the original (In fact, it's rather poor compared to the other games, but still somewhat catchy....). Nevertheless, the game gives you that sweet and familiar MegaMan 2 feel as you play through the respective robot masters' stages.....until you get to Dr. Wily's castle. Once you reach Dr. Wily's castle, that mad scientist throws MegaMan into a trap. That trap is the Teleport System. There are 4 teleports, right? Well, that means that there are 4 more robot masters (taken from MegaMan 3) that you must fight. However, in the first game, you just fight them. In this game, you actually have to play through their stages! So, I think it's safe to say you're no longer playing MegaMan 2. You're playing a fraction of MegaMan 3! After defeating those robots, you then play through Dr. Wily's stage. Challenging? Well, it may take trial and error for a part or two, but let's hope you still have Energy Tanks. The final boss will require you to use some as your health bar may deplete during the battle. Overall, this is a great game that I recommend any MegaMan to purchase. Plus, the difficulty is more fair here than in other MegaMan games, so new MegaMan players should start here.

I clearly recall video game magazines and people discussing it quite often in the mid 90's.  Anyway now that I've finally experienced the game for myself, I think it's just an alright RPG.  It has some really amazing aspects such as the quirky and humorous storyline elements that occurs during conversations with the characters- this stuff personally reminds me of Simpsons-style humor more often than anything else which is a HUGE plus in my book.  It's almost like the game is making a mockery of the way characters communicate with each other in RPG's, but it's often subtle and easy to overlook if you're not paying close enough attention. I also think that when the humor is set aside so the seriousness of the storytelling gets going, there's a TON of emotional and sincere moments that are honestly capable of being placed in the same category as any of the stellar moments from the Final Fantasy series.  Earthbound actually reaches *that* level of excellent storytelling.  It simply does a wonderful job making all the main characters important which is what a well-told RPG story is supposed to do.  I'd probably prefer a different angle besides the same tired old \"young heroic boy must gather friends and save world from destruction\" plot that's been done WAY too many times, but I understand this was a popular theme in the mid 90's for turned-based RPG's so I'll give it a free pass. Speaking of turn-based RPG's, it's no secret I've never really liked them.  I don't like the idea of being defenseless in battle while leveling up enough points/experience just to progress the story/gameplay, however Earthbound takes the all too familiar turn-based style and makes it so simplistic that I can't really find any faults with it.  I unfortunately sort of think enemies on screen are very bland and lifeless when the actual battles begin.  They basically show no movement or animation whatever and instead rely on making noises or blink/flicker occasionally to indicate they've taken damage, but that's all they really do.  It's really boring.  At least the menus and delivering spells and attacks while keeping an eye on your HP is done in a very easy to understand and faultless way.  No confusion whatsoever there which I like. Now to give the game a tremendous compliment, the music is absolutely *brilliant*.  I seriously like this music more than just about everything Chrono Trigger provides (except for the victory theme, hehe) and probably more than 80% of the music I've heard from the Final Fantasy series.  The music is constantly terrific no matter where you explore in Earthbound.  Whether it's the Asian temple areas, the mysterious dark caves or roaming through the towns/neighborhoods, the music constantly feels more meaningful and beautiful in Earthbound than it does in most RPG's.  The person/people responsible for writing this music deserves a bunch of credit.  The music seriously feels greater than video game music, almost like it's written from a classical performers perspective.  I especially like some of the trippier/more ambient stuff in the caves or during the enemy battles, which feels futuristic at times with its innovative techno style but constantly keeps my attention span in check.  The futuristic music in particular captures the ambience brilliantly.  The desert areas more playful/Band-like music can't be denied either.  The Band is an early 70's rock band if you don't know.  Or how about the particular creative battle theme that sounds similar to the bass work of a 50's or 60's jazz artist.  I can't say enough about the music overall.  Also how great IS it that each time you enter the battle (enemy) screen, you're awarded with a different theme?  Unlike Super Mario RPG with the same old tedious battle music that wears thin after a while. Speaking of music, how about the rock band characters you meet along the way?  They make up a crucial element to the story by frequently appearing in many spots of the game to assist your journey (and by the way your characters consist of Ness, Paula, Jeff and a guy named Poo).  I never would've guessed early on just how significant they'd become.  Also the police part near the beginning where you have to fight a bunch of them in a backroom... lol!  This game loves being humorous, but doesn't overdo it.  The carefree playfulness and exploration of the many buildings and homes is probably an even bigger element to the game.  How about that glowing fluorescent city area?  How cool is that place!  If you're not fighting dangerous monsters that possess deadly powers, you're fighting more innocent and playful things like a car and a parking meter, lol.  While this may sound really silly, it works in a way that's admirable and spices up what would've been just another typical RPG without these elements. I like how the main characters dad is important in the sense that you can withdraw/deposit money from him or from ATM machines which is a nicely implemented and different idea for using a games money system, but perhaps \"dear old dad\" overstays his welcome by constantly popping up throughout the game and questioning if you'd like to take a break.  Hey I remember when my parents would come into the living room and ask me the same question when I used to play video games for hours on end.  Clearly a message on the game creators part about encouraging kids to do more than sit around playing video games all the time. I HATE that cameraman who keeps dropping down from the sky to take your picture.  I don't get the purpose of this annoying character at all.  I must've missed something because I thought there was a reason for all this picture taking.  I fully expected a picture book to appear before the credits rolled at the end of the game showing all the pictures the cameraman was taking of the characters and their journey similar to the ending of Donkey Kong Country 3.  It doesn't happen that way.  Again though, I think I missed something obvious somewhere or perhaps didn't explore the game/towns enough to activate this feature.  Besides the weak generic-looking and bare backgrounds more reminiscent of an NES game and the diverse amount of areas you eventually explore which often feel somewhat tiny and incomplete, Earthbound is still pretty good and recommended for the story and humor which is emotional, uplifting, often creative and just consistently top-notch.  Even a guy like me who doesn't normally have the patience to play turn-based RPG's doesn't mind pulling out this game once in a while and playing it.</td><td>earth knows no bounds</td><td>1422144000</td><td>0</td><td>1164</td><td>5468</td><td>50</td><td>4.697594501718213</td><td>23.28</td><td>0.12242507</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>11223</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 24, 2014</td><td>B000035Y2Q</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Secret of Mana is one of those games I missed out on as a kid, despite having a pretty healthy Super NES collection in the early 90's.  Now that I'm experiencing the game in today's world as an adult where technology has advanced and the RPG genre has been perfected and perhaps exhausted, what's it like approaching a game like Secret of Mana now? Well to put it honestly, it's a pretty darn cool game!  Secret of Mana has been recommended to me literally 20 times by now by 20 different people over the last 15 years, so I finally had to see what all the fuss is about.  I mean if people are talking about the game NOW 20 years after release is has to be good right?  This game does so many things wonderfully that's it's almost indescribable how much fun it is.  The fast-paced action of not only running around but battling enemies in real time action instead of the typical and tiresome turn-based way, and being able to switch between 3 characters was an extraordinary technological step at the time compared to most RPG's where you could only play as one character. The music is another high point.  Probably not the very best music I've ever heard in an RPG, but pretty high up on the list of memorable video game music nonetheless.  It can be majestic in the castle areas, peaceful and ambient in the towns some of the time while more upbeat and happy in others, hoedown-ish in the caves, adrenaline-rushing during the boss fights, haunting carnival music appearing in a few areas, etc.  The ambient stuff happens to be my favorite aspects which is really surprising considering ambience is usually low on my list of favorite genres.  The emphasis on melody and emotion is really evident when listening to the themes in this game regardless what type of music it is.  I actually think the majestic castle theme is my favorite theme in the game.  It's sweeping, melodic and just awesome!  Hard to believe but this isn't the first time a majestic piece of music is my favorite song in a video game.  Super Castlevania IV is another example.  Two drastically different types of games of course (Secret of Mana and Super Castlevania IV). The boss battles... do you like fighting a ton of bosses?  I sincerely hope the answer is yes because I've NEVER seen so many boss fights in an RPG before, much less an old school RPG on the Super NES console.  An amazing amount of variety.  They appear unpredictably often times too which is another exciting element of the game.  Sometimes you're simply walking to the next area just minding your business nonchalantly exploring the lands and BOOM!  Boss fight time!  I like how you can switch between 3 playable characters which really enhances the excitement and tension found in the boss fights.  The magic spells are frequently used here, and it's necessary to use them particularly during boss fights because many bosses pack a mean punch. Now this game isn't flawless by any means.  It's unfortunate Secret of Mana does in fact contain a few flaws.  The biggest one is the dialogue.  While it's competent and certainly readable, it's pretty generic and forgettable often times.  Perhaps the emotional rollercoaster and perfection that is Terranigma has spoiled me into raising my expectations a few notches higher in relation to the RPG genre as a whole, who knows.  The lack of emotion by all the characters is pretty hard not to notice I'm afraid.  When I play an RPG I like to feel what the characters are feeling, but unfortunately for the most part this doesn't occur in Secret of Mana.  There's a big exception involving the main characters mother that I won't spoil however, and a few minor examples.  The townspeople however are all completely forgettable.  By the way I like the element of taking a nap and having your party's health restored.  Here I thought the Legend of Zelda series came up with this idea. Also the castles are average at best, and often times they're too short to make much of an impact.  The castles are also generic but it's surprising to me personally how short and straightforward they usually are.  You'll probably never get lost for a significant period of time.  The overworld is the same way I'm afraid.  Straight paths.  On another note I like when your character picks up a treasure chest and actually shakes the item out of there!  It's more unique than just opening the chest and obtaining the item like in Zelda.  I wish the dungeons were similar to Zelda in size, detail and impact.  The story is just okay.  Everything centers on the Mana.  Mana seeds need to be collected and the Mana Sword needs to be obtained.  Otherwise an evil empire will bring the always threatening underworld to life.  Expect lots of surprises pertaining to characters seeming relatively harmless only to drop a HUGE surprise that they're not what they once were when you see them again.  I won't spoil anymore though! At least the enemy variety (consisting of zombies, owls, colorful slimes, crabs, armored knights of many varieties, sizes and styles, pumpkins, zombie dogs, wizard eyeballs, bats, horseheads, mushrooms, bats, goofy-eyed water thugs, werewolves, specter ghosts, Kirby-like silktails, rabites, porcupine-like enemies called needlions, and more) are plentiful enough to spice up the average surroundings, and of course the bosses are REALLY varied and frequent.  On a personal note it bothers me the way the zombie dogs die.  They fall over so realistically that it makes me cry to see them lose their lives!  Oh and the bosses consist of giant two-headed dragons, lizards, giant bulky Gigas which are reminiscent of oversized dwarves, a gypsy snake, a giant glob of slime, deceivingly tiny bosses that look more like regular enemies called Tonsole and Biting Lizard and even a robot.  Talk about a HUGE variety! Overall really amazing RPG.  I strongly recommend it despite a few flaws.</td><td>secret of success</td><td>1411516800</td><td>0</td><td>1056</td><td>4818</td><td>50</td><td>4.5625</td><td>21.12</td><td>0.09980263</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>11264</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>04 15, 2016</td><td>B000035Y3N</td><td>Ryan Sil. (Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>Now THIS is a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game! Back when Konami was a video game company, they actually put forth effort in their craft, whether their works be original or licensed! Turtles in Time is not only one of the highlights in their Super Nintendo work, but is also perhaps the best TMNT game there ever is! So much so that more recent games in the franchise in the beat 'em up genre try to emulate the feel of the arcade games, yet lack anything that actually made them super fun to play, particularly Turtles in Time. So what makes this game so awesome? Well...Everything, really! The graphics are thoroughly detailed, crisp, and colorful all around; while this game was originally released in arcades, this Super NES port does a superb job of not only replicating the visuals, but even uses Mode-7 for the background of one of the stages. As for the music...HOLY CRAP did they go all out!! It's certainly one of the most energetic, head-bopping compositions I've heard from a Konami game! Each track is on-point, and suits the scenery and ongoing action perfectly! The instrumentation even surpasses that of the arcade's take on the soundtrack! And with this winning combination of brilliant graphics and music, it's fair to assume the gameplay stacks up as remarkably, and you can bet it does! As can be expected from a beat 'em up game, the idea is to beat the crap out of anybody that's onscreen. However, the best beat 'em ups know how to take advantage of this idea by strategically placing types of enemies and even environmental hazards to keep things interesting; the classic TMNT games in general have done a good job of this, but Turtles in Time takes the cake with its extra dose of variety and control flexibility. The player could mash the attack button and whale on baddies simply like that, OR the player could hit an enemy to either gain the opportunity to grab his wrist and throw him around, hitting surrounding baddies, or even THROW HIM INTO THE FRICKIN' SCREEN!! There are many ways to kill enemies, and there are many kinds of enemies to kill (EX: Specifically colored Foot Soldiers either use a projectile or try sneaking up to the Turtle to grab him), and the feel of it all is nothing short of addictive and upbeat! Aka FUN! Don't expect to master it too quickly, however. Much like many games from Konami at its prime, there is a difficulty curve; this one, although, is actually fairly accessible. Granted, the learning curve is still considerably high when taking into account the enemy/hazard patterns, but the game doesn't throw it at you all at once. It rather tries building up to that point where things become pretty challenging, but never to an absurdly unfair degree. Basically, the oldschool kind of hard that would only make the player feel completely rewarded after finally beating that one level or boss. Should anybody have a brutal time, though, the game does have options to start out with seven lives instead of three. As much as I'd like to say there are also difficulty options..... .....If there's anything I have to give the game not as much props for, it's what happens when beating the game on a lower difficulty than Hard: The game just cuts to a screen with Splinter saying \"Hey, guess what? You should probably beat the game on a harder difficulty if you want an actual ending!\" I know length was a common concern even back then, but game developers should have learned that this was not the way to increase game time. I'm perfectly fine with this game lasting under an hour. It's a fantastic hour to experience. I didn't need to be blocked off from viewing the ending all because I decided to make things slightly easier for myself by picking Normal instead of Hard. That said, the Lives option should help give players a more comfortable venture.

This is a short game overall however.  Less than 30-40 minutes regardless which version you play.  I really think the Genesis pulled off the impossible and actually made a game that surpasses not just the Super NES version, but the arcade one as well. As for the game itself, well it's a Contra-style shoot 'em up type of game where you scroll forward shooting enemies on screen.  The difference is that Sunset Riders takes place in the Wild West so expect to see all the familiar places you're accustomed to seeing in a western setting such as the towns, horses, cowboys, wild ladies, etc.  I think the Super NES has one REALLY strong aspect going for it however- the music is absolutely *incredible*.  I love singing along to the music.  It takes western/Spanish themes and combines them with upbeat rhythms you can dance to, and the notes themselves are REALLY catchy!  You can play as different characters but I'm unable to see a major difference between them, or if there even are any differences. The challenge is OUT OF THIS WORLD hard!  You die in one hit!  You can come back again in the same place you died a few more times, but it's not like it matters since you're still always being surrounded by danger around every corner.  It seems like the Genesis version tones down the craziness of bullets flying everywhere and makes the game more manageable, but either way whichever version you pick up you're going to be in for a rough -but fun- time due to the high challenge level that never gets any easier. In fact by the end of the game it just gets too crazy to even tolerate!  I don't even know if someone can improve their skills with a game like this- it's more like if you're focused enough to dodge several bullets you'll succeed (but even that's questionable given the high challenge) but if say, you happen to have a rough night of sleeping and wake up feeling tired and you're NOT on top of your game?  Forget about it!  Don't even play this game under these conditions, haha!

Nah it's not.  It's possible.  It's possible to beat this game.  I know because I've watched people do it before.  But your patience level needs to be at its absolute highest in order to get *anywhere* in this game.  With a game so tough it's no wonder most people back in the day only played it a couple times, realized how hard it was and put it away for years until they eventually sold it.  I know I would've done the same thing had I not had prior knowledge of this games incredible difficulty. Not getting through level 1 was a bad enough experience for me, but I already knew what to expect going into the game so I didn't mind the loss.  I didn't take losing personally.  No, not when you're playing a game with a reputation for being extremely hard.  You learn to KNOW better!  Some people just didn't know what they were getting into when they played this for the first time (and probably now with a whole new generation of gamers, you could pull a really dirty trick on them and say \"Hey!  Check out THIS game!  I know you'll love it!\" and see what their reaction is like, lol).  Probably a face-ripping reaction... that being your face. What makes the game so tough is a combination of 3 things- 1 is the play control.  Growing up with the NES generation I never minded awkward moving and jumping if the surrounding danger was kept to a minimum. Unfortunately the surrounding danger in this game is *constant* with many precious deadly surprises around every corner, and enemies are located in places *just* off-screen and appearing magically when you move over one notch.  Just enough for you to take an unavoidable hit in the cheapest way ever.  Throw in water stages and platform logs you have to ride across, and how about a level that moves up and down while riding a platform all the while avoiding surrounding dangerous enemies and their attacks, and that's the kind of nightmare-ish encounters you can expect in Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts.  The game *wants* you, BEGS you, to take a walk into dangerous territory just so you can take a hit. The 2nd reason for this games high challenge and for me clearly the biggest reason, is the fact that you can only get once or twice and then you die.  If at least 5 different enemies and attack are occurring all around you giving you little time to react, the generous and actually *right* gameplay method is to allow the player to take at least more than 1 or 2 hits.  Even Castlevania with its amazingly high challenge is courteous enough to allow the player to take at least 3-4 hits.  Imagine if you couldn't even wear protective gear while roaming through the levels of Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts?  Then it simply becomes \"1 hit you're dead\".  At least Contra allows the player to reappear in the same spot after a death.  No, in this game you either have to start back at the beginning of the stage or the nearest checkpoint.  The gameplay is already sluggish enough- it's not worth the aggravation believe me. And the 3rd reason is one I already mentioned- enemies being cheap.  Too many enemies on screen?  Yes.  Enemies with unpredictable movements with no clear pattern to retaliate?  Oh yeah (those DARN bird creatures have no pattern and you have to deal with more than 1 on screen occasionally!) Oddly the boss fights are relatively easy compared to the regular enemies that often swarm the stages.  Too much commotion taking place to properly focus on enemy elimination is an unforgiveable issue.  I guess the good news is that at least the levels aren't boring. To Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts credit a massively challenging game does sometimes have its moments of fun... when you're partying with friends and falling down drunk.  Or when a cat is taking its claws and scratching your face to shreds.  Or when you're so cold your feet feel like swollen icicles.  Or when the Dallas Cowboys are winning.  Under these conditions the game is probably fun, but not when you have a nice library of more sensible and enjoyable games sitting just a few feet from where you stand.  Oh and... before I forget!  If you're somehow able to make it to level 7, you HAVE to use the right weapon to eliminate the boss here otherwise the game will actually kick you back to level 1 preventing you from entering level 8.  That's silly, annoying, ridiculous, pathetic and horrible all wrapped in a nice package for grandma. Otherwise this game has really memorable music, fantastic Super NES graphics/superbly detailed backgrounds, and only a little bit of replay value obviously due to the high challenge level but also the fact that the game is short at just over 40 minutes (if you're an amazing enough gamer to blast through these tough stages that is- for the rest of us Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts takes hours to finish).  I recommend skipping this one.  Contra III: The Alien Wars is the other ridiculously hard Super NES game but at least it's fairer.</td><td>the challenge of a lifetime</td><td>1152662400</td><td>1</td><td>915</td><td>4021</td><td>51</td><td>4.394535519125683</td><td>17.941176470588236</td><td>-0.021424826</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>11477</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>08 6, 2013</td><td>B000035Y6N</td><td>Bryan</td><td>If Chrono Trigger is widely considered the best turn based RPG ever, I guess there's no argument to say otherwise.  Certainly no argument from me given the limited amount of experience I have with these type of games, but keep in mind I hate turn based RPGs.  I avoided them like the plague during my Super NES obsession 20 years ago.  I think the combat stinks because you have to take hits to actually *deliver* hits during combat (hence the \"turn based\" part of the genre) and the storyline is usually overlong, elaborate and exceptionally grand and elegant in a phony/uninteresting kind of way.  The presentation is the same unbearably pretentious way.  If this were a movie I'd get completely lost or uninterested in a matter of minutes and would shut it off, but for the sake of a video game with a reputation as being the best ever and a can't miss title, I decided to keep going. Chrono Trigger's storyline is enticing and lures me in during the first half but then other characters get thrown into the story such as Schala, Melchior, Janus and Prophet and it turns extremely confusing in a hurry.  The game should have continued the pace it had in the first half with the robot (really incredible that I actually feel sympathy for a robot in a video game of all places, but the game manages to make me feel bad for him), and even though I hate that a frog is part of the characters since it just seems totally silly to take an amphibian seriously, he's at least sometimes memorable.  Ayla's indiscernible english is a chore to read for the player (added worse by her frequent appearances throughout the quest, ugh).  Marle is confusing in the beginning which probably should have been taken as an indication that this game was going to be difficult to follow from a storyline perspective.  I guess she's a princess?  And she's several other people too?  Who really knows. Magus is supposed to be the bad guy but then a character named Lavos comes out of nowhere and I get lost.  Right when Glenn and Cyrus appear that's when the confusion escalates and loses me to the point that I was never able to recover.  The truth is, a video game storyline needs to be kept short and simple for me to understand.  Chrono Trigger is the exact opposite of that.  It's cool if you guys like it though.  I won't knock the game and give it a low rating just because I have trouble understanding sophisticated storylines in video games.  This is a fault of mine- not the game.  But perhaps the worst aspect is all the time travelling.  NOW I'm totally lost.  I can't keep track of all the past, present and future events that take place.  Knowing exactly what to do with a mess of timeline portals has to result in me using a FAQ to figure out. Do they still create turn based RPGs these days?  I can't bother to keep up with video games like I did when I was a kid.  I like the magic spells with the lightning, fireballs, icecube attacks, etc.  These are fun to watch and were really impressive back in the mid 90's.  Anyway a 3-star rating is fair.  This has to be the best turn based RPG I've ever played given it's only the second one I've ever played (Super Mario RPG being the other).  Take that for what it's worth.</td><td>a great big adventure... too big in fact</td><td>1375747200</td><td>0</td><td>613</td><td>2601</td><td>29</td><td>4.243066884176183</td><td>21.137931034482758</td><td>-0.003968254</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>11553</td><td>2.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>10 28, 2006</td><td>B000035Y2W</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Bart's Nightmare is a REAL nightmare.

I love the way the game works: when you are in a grapple with your opponent you press all the buttons as quickly as you can, to try and deliver a move!  It's incredibly fun but if you consider yourself to be someone not fast on the controller you WILL find this to be a difficult task. Unfortunately, you pretty much HAVE to grapple your opponent (by standing next to them and hitting the X button) because simply punching and kicking them for an entire match won't get the job done.  In fact, many times the second you punch or kick your opponent, they want to put you in a grappling hold, forcing you to quickly press all the buttons to either deliver a move, or break free. WWF Raw is such a good game, though.  It's also much better than the previous game (WWF Royal Rumble) in every single way.  Now, not only do you have finishing moves, you also have SUPER moves (moves that would be impossible to perform in real-life).  To give you an example of a SUPER move: Bret Hart spins around a bunch of times off a turnbuckle before landing on your opponent, or the 1-2-3 Kid bouncing back and forth on the top two turnbuckles.  Or how about Bam Bam Bigelow turning into Superman and VERY quickly charging across the ring?  That's just a few of the incredible SUPER moves you will see in this game.  Of course you also have finishing moves for each wrestler, such as Bret Hart and Owen Hart's Sharpshooter, Razor Ramon's Razor's Edge and the Undertaker's Tombstone Piledriver, to name a few.  Please note that neither SUPER or finishing moves are required to defeat your opponent.  You don't have to perform them. Let's not forget about all the REGULAR moves that have been added.  There weren't NEARLY this many in WWF Royal Rumble.  Any one of the buttons on the Super NES controller in a grappling hold will deliver a different move.  That's awesome. This game has really exciting options.  There's a lot of them to choose from, also.  The Royal Rumble option is still my very favorite feature (where you have 6 wrestlers in the ring at once, and the object is to throw all of them over the top rope and to the outside of the ring, until ONE man is left standing- this is VERY fun, and yes, it's exactly the same as the Royal Rumble option in the previous game). The Tag-Team and Bedlam touraments will always remain *extremely* awesome because there's a bunch of ways you and your partner can defeat your opponents.  You can pin them, you can count them out of the ring, you can tag your partner so HE can deliver the pinfall, and many more ways. The music is always diverse and interesting, and in some cases, very close to the way it sounds in a real WWF arena (WWE, today) such as Bam Bam Bigelow, Razor Ramon, and Owen Hart's theme. You also couldn't ask for a better selection of wrestlers.  You have your tall, tough guys like the Undertaker and Diesel, the overweight guys (Bam Bam Bigelow and Yoko Zuna) the technical wrestlers (Bret Hart and Owen Hart) and the funny goofy wrestlers, such as Doink and Lex Luger.  I don't know what category you'd place Shawn Michaels, possibly the best wrestler in the game. This game has it all, and it's a shame they don't make wrestling games like this anymore.  Today, wrestling games are all about realism, which means the market is flooded with games that are all basically the same thing, only with minor updates with each release.  A waste of money THOSE games are. I could keep talking about WWF Raw on the Super NES forever.  The fun I have smacking my opponents head with a bucket or chair, the surprise of facing someone one-on-one and having someone come out in the middle of the match to interfere (forcing me to face TWO wrestlers), the fun of running into/punching the referee, throwing my opponent into the turnbuckle and repeatedly running into them, throwing my opponent out of the ring and repeatedly into the gate on the left and right side of the ring (or the side of the ring itself!).

It was *awesome* the way the game encouraged you to roam around many graphically-appealing worlds searching for gems and dragons.  Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage proves to be an even BIGGER journey. I honestly didn't think it was possible to surpass the original Spyro game.  It was truly one of the greatest adventure games on the Playstation.  I can only find a couple VERY minor problems with Ripto's Rage.  Let's get them out of the way: - I think the biggest problem is the fact that, once again, the up and down buttons on the directional pad are *still* reversed.  This means, for example, when you go underwater in one of the water levels, you have to hit the Up button to swim down, and the Down button to swim up.  There's a couple other places in the game where the controls are reversed, too.  As far as I know there's NO way to change it to normal.  None of this may seem like a big deal but there's certain obstacles in the game that require you to move quickly through the water, and you want *everything* to be as perfect as possible while you swim to your destination, but thanks to the controls, it won't be easy.  Personally, I've never been able to adjust to it- every so often I will forget that the up and down buttons are reversed when I enter a water or flying stage, so I might swim or fly STRAIGHT into an enemy.  It's mind-boggling to me why the game creators haven't corrected it, or at the very least, gave the player an option to change it. - I find it slightly disappointing that, this time around, every stage has exactly 400 gems.  In the original, each stage had a different amount of gems for you to locate, which made Spyro's first adventure seem like more of a mysterious guessing game.  Not really complaining, though. - A TON of cutscenes are included in Ripto's Rage.  You can skip over them if you want, but I'm amazed that EVERY level has a cutscene in the beginning of a stage and another cutscene after you successfully complete the stage.  Don't worry, Ripto's Rage is still a huge game, maybe even bigger than the original.  In other words, the cutscenes don't suck up all the space on the disc.  Ignoring the cutscenes you STILL have a lengthy game. - This brings us to the next minor problem: the reason we have so many cutscenes is because each stage has a different odd-looking creature living in it, and these creatures (who happen to speak English very well) always want to discuss with Spyro the problems inside their world that they'd like you to fix for them.  Just the fact that EVERY stage features a different talking creature is both a good and bad thing.  A player might think Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage is throwing in TOO MUCH and therefore, you may assume you need to try and remember all the characters you come across in order to follow a story (which isn't true because once you complete a stage, most of the time you never see that character again, so please do NOT worry about having to follow along to any kind of complex storyline).  BUT, on the other hand, all sorts of wild-looking talking friendly creatures communicating with Spyro makes the game THAT much more adventurous. Those are the only complaints I can find, and when you think about it, those are pointless complaints because the game does so many things right. I honestly believe the challenge has been increased significantly in Spyro's second adventure.  Instead of three or four dragons scattered throughout each stage waiting for you to find and rescue, you now have to search for three or four bonus games per stage and you HAVE to successfully complete most of them, which would be an extremely positive thing EXCEPT for the fact that a small handful of these bonus games are REALLY hard to complete. Each time you complete a bonus game you receive an orb.  There's 64 orbs in the game total, and to reach the final boss, you're required to find 40 of them.  In my opinion, probably no more than 10 bonus games are impossibly hard so you SHOULD be able to go through the stages, collect 40 orbs, and beat the game.  Just don't expect to get all 64 orbs because, again, some of those bonus games are difficult. I'm not knocking the bonus games.  After all, it's more interesting to tackle a creative and exciting bonus game than to simply walk up to a frozen dragon and rescue him, like in the original.  In Spyro 2 you don't know WHAT kind of bonus game you'll encounter, which makes the game overall one notch better than the original.  To give a few examples of the bonus games you play: one of them has you playing hockey on ice where you have two minutes to make five goals, another bonus has you trying to quickly burn eight dangerous dragons before they eat the good guys (don't even ask me WHAT these good guys are supposed to be- let's just say they're friendly people that really love you!) another bonus stage has you swimming through rings.  A whole bunch of creative, interesting bonus games await you.  Even if you lose at some of them, you will want to try them again because they're so much fun. People who are familiar with the original might be confused when they reach the end of the game and realize that they only explored three worlds.  The original game featured five worlds, however, the three worlds in Ripto's Rage feature more stages.  So it balances out. The graphics are *exactly* the same as the original.  I can't find a single improvement, or at least, anything different.  The exact same graphic engine.  Oh, and thankfully the creators remembered that very important option to change the camera angle to \"active\".  VERY important! Stewart Copeland from the rock band the Police returns and succeeds with another fantastic soundtrack.  Another all-around excellent job. My favorite thing about this game are the three boss fights you encounter at the end of the three worlds.  All three of these bad guys are EXTREMELY AWESOME to fight (sorry, I'm in the mood to whip out the big letters!) It is SO much fun shooting fireballs at them.  They also force the player to find a strategy in order to defeat.  You never really came across a boss fight in the previous Spyro game that required a certain strategy. I love the fact that everywhere you go you find LOADS and LOADS of gems and other things.  The levels and worlds in this game are packed with things to find.  Positively PACKED.  A truly awesome game.  The first Spyro the Dragon game was awesome too.  Swimming around really adds more flavor and magic to the game.  Yeah, despite the control problem I mention above, swimming around still manages to be pretty fun.  Of course, there's a lot of running around too.  In fact, there's more running than swimming overall.

The sounds and music are also just as amazing! The gameplay is also pretty good, but it's always varied, although it's mostly a platform game. However, the game is hard. Although things are easier after beating it once. The storyline is horribly written in the game. For example: \"I'm so mad that I can't see where I'm going!\" However, you'd just skip the storyline cutscenes anyway. What? We've all done it.

Most video games based off movies aren't good.  Most of them are, in fact, horrible.  However, Toy Story manages to stay at the top of its game long enough for any gamer to admit it is an overall good game. You play as Woody, traveling through the full length story of Toy Story.  The game is comprised of seventeen levels with story sequences in between.  Most levels are basic side scrollers where you'll progress through the level as Woody with a few bosses in there.  The levels range in variety.  Not just basic side scroll levels, but there are a couple of levels where you'll control RC and a few levels where you'll be riding on a certain toy to get through a barage of obstacles in your way.  Woody's \"life gauge\" is at the top of the screen.  He has five hit points.  When they're all used up you'll have to restart the level.  Luckily, throughout these levels there are checkpoints for Woody to fall back on. There are fifty stars in each and every level of Toy Story.  They're scattered around much like coins in Mario.  If you get fifty Woody will get an extra life.  If you come close he might get a few hit points restored instead.  The levels aren't long and some of them are fairly simple to go through. Graphically, Toy Story looks really good for a Super Nintendo game.  The freeze frame scenes from the move are of the actual movie itself, and Woody and the other toys move quite smoothly.  There are a few frame rate issues from time to time.  Moments when Woody will abruptly slow down but the action around him doesn't.  This could cost you more than a few hit points.  Some levels, such as controling RC, are downright frustrating. The music is a tough call.  It isn't exactly the greatest sound track but it isn't bad either.  It would've been nice if they'd borrowed more tunes from the movie.  The music doesn't get repetative (there's different music for each and every level) but it just doesn't always sound great.  Not only that, but some of the story sequences are horribly written. The game does present a good challenge, however, as most classic Super Nintendo games.  You'll find yourself in trouble a few times.  However, I have to point out that even for a Super Nintendo game it's short.  For a late Super Nintendo it's short.  The game can be completed within a half hour.  Compare that with other SNES games (that aren't RPGs) that take at least 5 or 6 hours to beat and you'll wonder if Toy Story is really worth the time.  I'd say it is.  It's fun, and it's interesting.  For Super Nintendo junkies, you might want to get a hold of it.  It's actually a game based off a movie that's good, and that alone deserves a peak.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>Mickey Mania was one of the last games Sony had created before the company went on to make the Playstation. The music and sounds have a higher quality than the Genesis version, but there are loading times in between levels. The first level takes you to the iconic Steamboat Willie cartoon. However, if you think that the first level is supposed to be simple, think again. There are numerous obstacles that are most likely to hurt you. If you get hit, you are only invincible for half a second. What makes the gameplay become fun is when you start collecting these spheres and then later throw them at enemies. You soon encounter ol' timey Pete, but he actually isn't the boss. Hit him 4 times and use him as a spring to bounce over a pile of crates. The REAL first boss is the machinery. You must destroy 4 gears by hitting them 5 times (3 times for the top ones) The boss, at first, plays incredibly hard, since the crates drop bombs on you. However, you don't find out til later to figure out that you can just jump to avoid getting blown up. After the boss, Mickey appears with Steamboat Willie. Then the text says \"Congratulations! Mickey has rescued Steamboat Willie!\" What? He was kidnapped? The second level is, one of my favorites, The Mad Doctor. Right when you encounter a skeleton, things get hard. When the skeletons get destroyed, their bones fly up and fall down, but you actually had to avoid colliding with them. There are several portions of this level. After the first part, the second part contains rope swinging over lava. The third has you ride a runaway mine cart, but you must jump over the incoming spike balls. There's also this part where you must perform chemistry. The downside here is that if you push it to the stool without the 3 layers you have to put in, the only decision is to kill yourself. The Mad Doctor doesn't seem like a very hard boss until you attack. If hit, he throws full flasks all over the place. The third level is Moose Hunters. If you don't follow Pluto on this one, you're dead. Countless tree branches and boulders would fall on you. Moose would also gallop towards you at certain times. After beating the first part, things get easier, yet awkward. You now have to run away from a moose in a beautifully stupid fake 3D level. The Lonesome Ghosts is your fourth level. Going up certain staircases would make them turn into a ramp. There are tilting platforms that you must tilt in the right direction to go on. The second part is annoying. You have to balance on a barrel while the house is being flooded. As you make your way towards left, the third barrel would sink, but if you get closer to the left, the water stops. That's the annoying part: The water. If you jump in, you lose your life automatically basically. Mickey and the Beanstalk is graphically colorful. There's not a lot of hard stuff in here. Although I must admit the dragonflies are annoying. When you get to the first huge enemy, you'd think it'd be a boss since boss music is playing, but no. You must hop on a ladybug. The ladybug speeds away from the \"boss\" extremely. Once you reach the giant's house, there's a plate with Jello on it. You have to push it towards the wall, but you probably won't know it at first, since it's a big object to push. Now...the Prince and the Pauper....it's the hardest and final level of the game. You swing, you kill, all that stuff. Unfortunately, I can't explain anymore since you must find about this on your own. Good luck. Overall, if you are a die-hard fan of platform games, Mickey Mouse, or you just want a major challenge, go ahead and buy this game.</td><td>Daring revisit through time</td><td>1293494400</td><td>0</td><td>661</td><td>2956</td><td>58</td><td>4.472012102874433</td><td>11.39655172413793</td><td>-0.008646322</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>11965</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>11 24, 2010</td><td>B000035Y6D</td><td>Ryan Sil.

The Super Nintendo triumphed over its previous system with 16-bit graphics and its then-new Mode 7 technology in which it performs glorious fake 3D.

While the NES lasted from 1985 to 1994, the SNES went on from 1991 all the way to 2003, and yet it still remains to be a popular system! It is that awesome.</td><td>One of the best systems ever made</td><td>1290556800</td><td>1</td><td>98</td><td>426</td><td>6</td><td>4.346938775510204</td><td>16.333333333333332</td><td>0.2701923</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>12020</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>01 4, 2004</td><td>B000035Y6D</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>Anyone who was around in the NES days knows how fun those games were. Nearly anyone around for the Super Nintendo generation will without a doubt call it: The Greatest System of the Gaming World. While many have updated to the PS2, GCN and XBOX, the SNES is still strong even to this day. The games are classics (and actually led to a lot of successful games found on the PSX and PS2) and don't depend so heavily on eye-candy and if you can believe it, PSX games like Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy VII made people WANT an SNES even more (so we could play Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy III/VI). So what makes the SNES so strong in not only Nintendo's franchise, but in gaming in general?  Well, to start off the controller is by far the most comfortable of any game system ever.  The controller has lead to other controllers that have copied the design (The PSX/PS2 controller is almost an exact duplicate). Second is these games are incredible!  The SNES has some of the greatest games of any series. Several FF fans call FFVI the best one, several Zelda fans call Link to the Past the best one, several Mario fans call Super Mario RPG the best one.  Not to mention we've had lots of gaming goodness.  The Donkey Kong Trilogy, Secret of Mana, Contra III, the Mega Man X series debuted here as well.  The Super Nintendo set the standard for gaming as we know it!  How many of us were blown away by Donkey Kong Country when it was released? A whole lot of us were! Compare the amazement DKC gave off to what DK64 gave off. Several different genres, the SNES provides great Action/Adventure, RPGs, Puzzles and more!  The SNES even has educational games.  It's the perfect family console! But there are a few problems.  The first one being the system is out of date and it's actually harder to find now. But you can get it at a cheap price (usually ranging from 25 to 50 bucks). The second con is...some of the games that are really popular, are sold for OUTRAGEOUS prices! Go to ebay and type in Chrono Trigger and you'll see that go for as much as 300 dollars!  Other games that are really popular have been released on the Gameboy Advance (Such as The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Donkey Kong Country).  So while the games are great, some you'll have to be willing to pay a lot for, others are re-released and can't rekindle the magic of the original. The Good: +Still strong after all these years! Thanks to the GBA many remember what a gem the SNES was! +Fantastic games! Super Metroid, Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, Mega Man X series, DKC Trilogy and the list goes on and on! +Best Controller +Quite a durable system...I've had mine for 12 years and it still looks brand new! +Easy to work and games are easy to play and get into.

So Nintendo makes their own 16-bit system, but used a much better graphics and sound chip than the Genesis had, and remained the top system until Sony's Playstation came out in 1996.  What made the Super NES kick so much was its outstanding library of games.  The first party titles were out of this world, not to mention the system also had some of the best RPG's to date on any system.  All in all, if you can find a Super NES anywhere, I highly recommend buying one, its a piece of video game history, and Nintendo has not been able to make a better system yet.  Below is a list of games that are also recommended to get along with the system for the best playing experience: Super Metroid Super Mario World Yoshi's Island Super Mario Kart Final Fantasy 3 Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Contra 3 Super Mario All-Stars Street Fighter 2 Turbo Tetris Attack Donkey Kong Country Earthbound Chronotrigger Super Mario RPG</td><td>Bar none, its one of the best systems ever made</td><td>1025568000</td><td>1</td><td>193</td><td>859</td><td>6</td><td>4.450777202072539</td><td>32.166666666666664</td><td>0.34608695</td><td>805</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>12070</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 28, 2014</td><td>B000038ABO</td><td>Bryan</td><td>You know I actually think Parasite Eve is a pretty awesome game despite being told to avoid it many years ago.  This is because I've finally convinced myself that lengthy storylines DO deserve a place in the video game genre.  When this game first came out I was busy enjoying either my Super NES or early action games on the PS1 such as Loaded, WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game and several others so I wasn't so willing to just open up and accept a very story-based video game since the concept was brand new to me at the time, and I resented the idea initially.  My logic was \"Um, shouldn't such detailed storyline be reserved for movies and books only?\" and the truth is I sometimes still feel the same way whenever I have to put up with a lengthy unskippable cutscene but you know times change and specifically video games have changed since the Super NES days, and we've pretty much reached the point where such stories HAVE to be included in video games for continuity reasons and for sequels to be made.  Also gameplay tends to feel stale nowadays so we look forward to stories above everything else (at least I feel this way).  I understand all this now. Anyway onto the review for Parasite Eve.  This game is just magnificent all around.  I think its biggest problem is being compared to the Resident Evil series which isn't really fair in my opinion, and specifically the enemies in Parasite Eve don't have the familiarity and worldwide love that zombies do.  People automatically veer towards zombies for some reason.  To me zombies are mostly overrated and often times come off as comical but I'm willing to make an exception when it comes to survival horror video games (at least in RE2 and 3 where zombies are actually terrifying while intensifying the mood and your surroundings).  However zombie movies are usually hit or miss for me and I don't quite get the love so many others do.  But the lack of everyone's precious zombie in Parasite Eve I believe (in my opinion) is a major contributor why this game never won over the majority of survival horror fans. The first half of the game centers on a *very* detailed horror story about an evil demon woman named Eve who actually has the potential to make people burn to death suddenly and dramatically (spontaneous combustion).  Let me tell you guys something- I've watched some cool cutscenes before but NONE of them come even close to the one that takes place in an opera theater in the beginning of this game.  It's absolutely AWESOME to watch!  To go from singing opera to the audience burning alive a moment later... talk about catching me by *complete* surprise!  I love it!  This cutscene is so beautiful and elegant and yet so twisted and demented at the same time- way ahead of its time for 1997 since combining beauty with oddness and horror wasn't a popular trend in either video games or movies until a few years later (unless my foggy memory is forgetting a popular movie and I might just be).  It's possible that since Parasite Eve's story is so well-told it might have been heavily influenced from another source. Anyway the first half of the game is all about the story with only brief elements of gameplay in between, while the second half places more emphasis on gameplay (shooting enemies and progressing) and less on story (until the conclusion which is 45 minutes of heavy story).  Parasite Eve uses static camera angles and pre-rendered backgrounds just like classic Resident Evil with many different camera angles enhancing the mood.  What makes Parasite Eve work so well is its VERY detailed, elaborate and sophisticated storyline.  Every single detail related to the virus \"mitochondrial\" (a word you'll be hearing a LOT throughout this game- get used to it) and how this evil monster named Eve is preparing to make the \"Ultimate Being\" and will even kill or burn people alive who dare to stand in her way is not only engrossing by itself but when you include the main playable and attractive character of Aya who works at the police department and mysteriously is NOT affected by Eve's antics, a Japanese scientist who's here to sort out this mess and a firm-voiced detective named Daniel, you have yourself a small but ultimately VERY memorable cast of characters.  There's plenty of mini characters too including Daniel's son and a sick-minded scientist helping to feed Eve's desires for creating the perfect living creature, etc. As you can guess, the storyline is LEAPS AND BOUNDS better than anything Resident Evil ever made, especially nowadays since the RE series is completely tarnished being an action-oriented game with generic unfitting Hollywood-ish segments that don't belong for the RE series, let alone the horror genre.  However compared to the classic RE games Parasite Eve destroys even those amazing games in terms of storyline.  Arguably the enemies are significantly better in Parasite Eve as well.  You encounter mutated oversized dogs, bears, insects, lizards, snakes, rats, dinosaurs and pterodactyl's (later on), etc.  These enemies often even have their own fireball or laser ball shooting moves which is quite unique to see in a grim survival horror setting.  Many of these enemies are downright frightening too.  Resident Evil's enemies are bland in comparison.  Aya, your main character, can carry several weapons and ammunition which smears what the classic RE games bring to the table in terms of arsenal variety. The environments mostly consist of the police department, hospital,  museum, ship and snowy city streets.  It's really all the game needs.  If I have any complaints well, for one thing the storyline gets really confusing in the second half when Aya's sister and mother are mentioned and how they tie into the Eve situation which never *quite* made sense to me but it's possible I was just getting burnt out by the final chapter and not focusing clearly anymore.  It sort of bothers me how un-dramatic the enemy encounters are- you simply walk along minding your business when suddenly the screen flashes white and invisible enemies turn visible before your eyes and the battle gets underway while mid-tempo music lacking suspense plays.  It doesn't capture the fear of being stuck in a dreadful trap NEARLY as effectively as the classic RE games.  In RE the music doesn't change at all when enemies appear on screen, and the enemies are already there upon entering a room (often times in plain view or you can hear them walking around in the back of the room).  I certainly prefer enemy encounters the RE way. Also your health bar is like an RPG based on numbers.  When you get attacked your numbers go down.  I prefer the herb/health status system in the RE games.  A lot of times enemies appear during aerial view camera shots which is probably a clever way of disguising game space limitations so there's more room to include more enemies. Overall however, this game is pretty awesome.  Perhaps its extremely big story means little replay value since you don't feel like plodding through such a large story just to get to the action parts which is understandable, but this game does everything right except for the way the enemy encounters are handled.  I LOVE any cutscene that either shows people burning alive or enemies such as rats or dogs transforming into beastly creatures which is quite graphic, gross and exciting.  Dare I say the best cutscenes ever in a PS1 game?  A really magnificent game.</td><td>watch out for that parasite</td><td>1411862400</td><td>0</td><td>1311</td><td>6131</td><td>49</td><td>4.676582761250954</td><td>26.755102040816325</td><td>0.07362337</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>12106</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>09 22, 2003</td><td>B000035Y5G</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>Probably on my top ten SNES games list, Tetris&Dr. Mario is a gem to own on your classic SNES.  I'll be a first to admit that I at first only bought this game for Tetris. I didn't play Dr. Mario on the original NES but I knew that Tetris was down right ADDICTIVE!  So I was a little reluctant to play Dr. Mario. But when I did that was fun too and just as addictive. First Dr. Mario.  The game shows Mario throwing pills in a jar and you must match the color up with the virus until three of the colors in a row are stacked up. Then the virus disappears.  Yep, that's all.  20 levels that you can select right away but the game goes on with no real ending either...just like Tetris. Tetris, I'm sure many of you have played it before. Whoever thought that making lines could become so addictive? You just place your blocks down until you form a line and then voila the line disappears.  What was best about this game for me? THERE IS NO ENDING! You select up to nine levels and there is actually a level 10...and 11....and 12...and 13 etc. The second best part. If you ever lost in Tetris it was mostly YOUR fault not the games fault!  It's you who must find the proper place for the block. And please tell me I'm not crazy when I say this, but did anyone else look at tiles in buildings and form pieces from Tetris? Also, did you dream of these blocks falling too? Well, I did because the game was just something branded in my mind and it's really nice to see it released for the SNES. Both of these games are great in another aspect. The fact that they're both simple.  Anyone could play these games and expect to have some sort of mastery at them.  I think a lot of video games are actually aimed at male players such as myself and a lot of female gamers can't get into them as easily. Well, this game is easy for anyone to get into. Sure it ain't shoot 'em up style kind of game, and you don't kill anyone but hey it's fun!</td><td>I couldn't have asked for anything more!</td><td>1064188800</td><td>1</td><td>384</td><td>1542</td><td>38</td><td>4.015625</td><td>10.105263157894736</td><td>0.15810959</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>12136</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>01 11, 2004</td><td>B000035Y38</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Many Star Fox games have been released since the very first one that appeared on the Super NES.  The only one I have ever played was the original on the Super NES, which also happened to be the most groundbreaking of all the Star Fox games, and it's a challenging and exciting game.  Perhaps the only game on the Super NES to have more enemies to shoot at than the Mega Man series.  The levels are packed. You're a fox, and you fly a plane.  You fly through the universe shooting and avoiding all sorts of wild looking creatures.  That's basically what you do.  You have animal friends available to help make your journey slightly easier.  It's a good idea to try to help out your friends if they're in trouble because keeping them alive might be to your advantage later on in the game. In Star Fox you really have to tap that shoot button because the further into the game you go, the more enemies you will encounter.  This is one tough game here folks.  Much harder than the Super NES Mega Man X games, and certainly much harder than the Mario and Donkey Kong Country games.  But come on!  You need a solid challenge every so often!  But it's certainly beatable.  And this game never gets tiring either. I remember when this game first came out and how a certain store in a mall had NOTHING but this game all over the shelves.  This game was packed on the shelves on the wall and the shelves in the middle of the store.  It was everywhere!  You couldn't avoid this game if you had to!  There must have been thousands of Star Fox games at that one tiny store that one weekend, when the game first hit the market.  The game was that popular. Everyone was making a big deal about this game because of the never-before-seen graphics.  Sure, today the graphics look pretty outdated and even more so compared to the newer Star Fox games, but at the time this was some new unique stuff that showed signs of the future of video gaming. I always feel satisfied making my way through Star Fox not only because it's a hard game, but also because it's a fun game.  Not a dull moment to be found anywhere.  Enemies constantly fly at you from all over the place.  Exciting stuff. You have three routes you can take.  Level 1 is the easiest and Level 3 is the hardest.  I can't even beat Level 3 in all the years I've been playing this game.  I can make it to the end on a good day but basically I'm lucking out.  That doesn't mean the game requires luck.  Just the final two places in Level 3 require some luck.  I can beat Levels 1 and 2. Incredible music.  I love every theme.  Very much like outer space music.  It all works.

You can choose a few paths, each with different levels to go through. The gameplay is pure (fake) 3D shooting at probably its finest. You can see all kinds of wacky machines shooting at you and/or passing by. You also have 3 teammates to \"help\" you. Slippy is annoying, though, as a bad guy would always chase him and you would have to rescue him from being attacked. There's always a boss at the end of every level.

What many condider the first survival horror game (although the original Alone in the Dark can be considered that as well), you play as either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine: both of whom are members of S.T.A.R.S.; an elite special forces group who are investigating a series of murders and attacks in Raccoon City.  They are led towards a mysterious mansion in the outskirts of the city and are sent in when the first team sent in is never heard from again.  Inside the mansion you are pitted against a horde of zombies, mutated dogs, beasts called hunters, and many more mutated lifeforms all straight out of a B rated horror movie.  What made the game so fun and addicting was the suspense (remember the part where everything is quiet and your walking down the hallway when out of nowhere the dogs come bursting through the window?) and the graphics engine which combined fully 3-D models of the characters and beautifully pre-rendered backgrounds.  While the \"find the key to unlock the door\" puzzles are tried and true (especially by today's standards), this original installment in the Resident Evil series is still loads of fun to play, and if you've never played it before than you should consider this essential playing.</td><td>Where it all began</td><td>1058572800</td><td>1</td><td>250</td><td>1171</td><td>12</td><td>4.684</td><td>20.833333333333332</td><td>0.05376249</td><td>805</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>12336</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>02 4, 2004</td><td>B000038ABQ</td><td>Bryan</td><td>I never owned a Sega Genesis so I never got to experience Road Rash on that system (where the series was popular).

And... yup, better graphics and sound and REALLY fun. I lost my copy of this game and I really can't believe I let that happen. As I mentioned in another review, normally I'm a very organized person. Apparently I need help keeping my games in one place! This game is really freakin' sick, and more importantly, fun. I adore hitting old ladies with my bike, along with construction workers and the half-naked girl who waves the start flag (can you blame me? she stands there like she WANTS to get hit!) It's really fun hitting people with your bike. It's fun kicking and punching people too, along with smacking them with chains and baseball bats. The point of the game is to do whatever you have to do to come in first place of the race. This version of Road Rash could have had more stages instead of five, but that's okay. The hard rock music that plays in each of the five stages is really awesome.

Bruce Willis is one of the first actors to have a game built with him as the main protagonist that is not based on a movie. The game features a very detailed Bruce for the time with some solid pre-rendered FMVs thrown in the mix as well. The game features a non coherent story that makes no sense, but when Bruce is involved it's all about the action right? The game has  an over the top view and you shoot all around you using the face buttons. You can jump, but as the camera goes, jumping can be a bitch and is probably the hardest part of the game. Not being able to move the camera in his environment is very frustrating and almost ruins the game. You can pick up different limited weapons such as homing missiles, plasma gun, eletro bolt etc. nothing special. Each level, however, is very well laid out and the enemies have nice designs. The game is hectic, face paced, and pretty immersive. At the end of every level is a boss fight and these can be easy or hard and they vary throughout the game. A problem I ran into is instead of using the second analog stick using the face buttons makes shooting diagonally hard, which leads me to mention that the difficulty is very unbalanced. Some levels are easy some are hard throughout the game and that's a bad thing. Bruce Willis lends his voice and there are maybe 20 or so lines...yeah that's it. Cliche stuff such as \"Ohhh you want some too?!\", \"Kill `em all it's time to jam!\", and various groans and grunts. In my mind that isn't using Bruce Willis to his fullest potential. This game could have been cooler and more than just a name tie in. I also feel a co-op mode would have been good here as well. All in all, Apocalypse is a fun weekend shooter, but nothing more.

First of all, let's get a few things straight- this is a 3rd person shooter game, and (ignoring the control set-up) the game looks and feels *exactly* like MDK (another action-packed 3rd person shooter for the Playstation).  I mean, the two games feel so much alike with the identical graphics and the same kind of occasional slowdown problems, it's almost hard to believe nobody has mentioned the comparison before. The one difference between the two games is that in Apocalypse, you have to actually use four different buttons on the Playstation controller to fire your weapon (by the way, your main gun has unlimited bullets which is very convenient).  Each buttons fires your weapon in a different direction.  For example, to shoot enemies that are located to the left of you, you have to hit the Square button.  Enemies to the right of you- Circle button.  Enemies behind you- the X button.  Finally (the button I personally use the most) the Triangle button to take out the bad guys located in front of you.  From a shooting-forward view, the game is exactly like MDK. I read all the reviews I could find for Apocalypse on the internet before buying the game, but I had NO idea just how many enemies each of the 11 stages would have.  We're talking about a LOT of enemies (such as giant tanks and laser beam shooting robots) that are simply COVERED in each of the 11 stages to the point where many times the levels are too crowded to even walk past them!  Luckily, the slowdown isn't too bad, though it happens sometimes.  It's completely forgivable though.  Honestly, when seven or eight robots are running in your direction at the same time, you'll probably be begging for a bit of slowdown. I really love the soundtrack.  We're talkin' hard rock tracks (since action games NEED energetic music, after all) that normally fit in with the background setting of each stage quite well.  When in a cave level, the music doesn't rock very hard and instead sets a necessary dreary mood.  On a street level, the rock turns into heavy metal, becomes faster, and definitely rocks the house down.  Speaking of the street level, my favorite part is when you're walking either down the street or along a building rooftop and you come across a giant TV screen which shows a band playing music.  The stage music then changes to whatever kind of music you happen to be hearing on the TV screen.  One TV screen showed a music video of a band playing a punk rock/grunge rock song.  I really liked this idea.  It gave me the impression that I was in a shopping mall or a carnival- places where activity changes suddenly, when walking only a few feet away.  Really cool idea. The thing that makes Apocalypse such a challenging game are all the platform jumps you have to do.  Sometimes the character you control gets really small when the camera pans out, and sometimes this happens at the *exact* moment when an important jump to a platform is needed.  In these situations, there's always a chance you won't be able to see what you're doing and your character won't make the jump, and die.  Fortunately, I haven't come across anything as annoying as the jumping in the bridge level of the original Crash Bandicoot, for instance.  If you've never played that game, BOY was that level a total nightmare!  You were required to land safely on top of these little pieces of wood barely holding a bridge together.  Yikes! The challenge in Apocalypse definitely goes up once you arrive to Level 6.  This is when some very careful platform jumps are required in order to access an upper section of the stage, and progress forward.  No doubt you will fall off a few times before getting it right.  Luckily in this level, you don't die if you fall off (well, for the first set of platforms) and you land on some solid ground that's directly below you. However once you reach Level 8, you REALLY need to pay attention to what you're doing or else you won't land safely on any of the many platforms and instead you'll go straight into the lava.  By the way, there's moving platforms and revolving platforms.  Once you reach Level 8, there's actually enemies standing on the moving platforms and shooting in your direction, making the difficulty go through the roof. I think the thing that REALLY gets to me about the occasional frustration factor of the game is how sometimes it appears that you're lined up exactly right to jump to the next platform, only for you to apparently be way off and then fall down into nowhere and die.  This happens frequently in a few places and it's really not fair.  It makes you think \"What the... how did THAT happen?\"  Luckily you can save your progress after each level you complete (thanks to a memory card) and I believe you always go back to 4 lives after a \"Game Over\" screen. The fact that health packs and weapons are located everywhere makes the game feel less frustrating.  Oh, and if I haven't mentioned it yet, the weapons in this game RULE.  They are really cool-looking.  The flamethrower totally rules.  Everything in front of you burns immediately when firing that weapon.  There's another weapon that's a giant purple lightning strike thing.  It fires across the room zapping all the bad guys.  Those are just a few.  Awesome weapons overall. I really love the sound effects in the game.  Your main character says a lot of funny things, and I really think he's saying the \"sh\" word in one instance.  I don't think a game company would normally allow that kind of language in a video game, but apparently they got away with it here.  The enemies also have their fair share of exciting lines (and often times, funny) to make the whole experience more interesting.  Unfortunately, the zombie level isn't anywhere as cool as the zombies found in the Resident Evil series.  They're just small little creatures that break apart into green balls once you kill them.  Aw, man! I should also note that using a regular Playstation controller is probably the best idea.  An analog stick may make certain platform jumps much harder than they need to be compared to a regular controller.  That's just my preference, though. I love the level designs.  I wasn't expecting so much creativity.  Besides the street and cave levels, you have a graveyard and a lava-facility kind of place.  Nice variety. Yet ANOTHER forgotten little action game for the Playstation gaming console.  I love it, and the challenge doesn't prevent me from giving the game a perfect score.

Actually, I'd probably go play Pokemon Sapphire again if I were to come back to Pokemon fandom. Now, let me tell you: I'm not one to troll Nintendo. I'm a HUGE Nintendo fanboy, just so you know (See lots of my other reviews for proof). But then when you look at Pokemon Stadium, you'd probably think: \"OMG POKEMON ON NINTENDO 64!!!\" It would be one of the best Nintendo games ever, considering how awesome the series was on Game Boy, right? WRONG. Pokemon Stadium isn't what you'd expect to be the next big entry in the franchise. Rather than it being an RPG, the series's turn-based battles replace it all! It's all about fighting your Pokemon. Nothing else. In turned-based battles. How the heck is that supposed to work? It's not. If it's an RPG with that stuff, then we'd be all over it. You CAN'T have the turn-based battles make up a whole game by itself. Okay, maybe it actually isn't ALL about the turn-based battles. There are minigames, and some of them can be rather interesting. But they only remind you that this should have been an RPG. We had to wait for Pokemon Colosseum to give us the experience that we really needed. This should be left alone, as one of Nintendo's few pieces of crap. At least the graphics were amazing for the N64.</td><td>Battles and minigames only??

Now, Mario Party 2 is considered to be the best of all the games in the series, and for great reason: There are lots of memorable minigames, catchy tunes, and fun virtual game boards. There are six boards, and there are about 50 minigames (I think). This game capitalized the board game-minigame hybrid. Now you find other board games with the word \"Party\" because of this game. Basically, you must go get Stars, but you need coins to pay for the Stars. Whoever has the most Stars wins. Every turn, there would be a minigame. Whoever wins the minigame gets 10 coins. The minigames have their own rules that separate from each other. You can read them in-game. There are also some more minigames that you can buy with a Mushroom piggy bank, which collects the coins you earned during the main game. There are some other game modes that have you fight to the finish by playing the minigames. Some of the minigames may be boring, but the huge majority of them are just plain fun. And also, who could forget the cannonballs that shoot you off the bridges at Pirate Land? Or how about the Bowser Parade in Bowser Land (unlockable board)?

In the case of Nintendo 64, they've had very few real sequel success stories with their video games. In the case of Mario Party, they've made a couple of very decent sequels to the popular game itself. Two of them made it to the Nintendo 64, the other is on the Gamecube. Mario Party 2 came out less than a year after the smash hit the Nintendo 64 game screens. The game picks off a little bit from the previous version, with the same six characters to choose from, but the games are a bit different than before. Most of the games are absolutely new to the system, including Cake Factory, Look Away, and Roll Call. There are also another few twists that are here that weren't in the previous game. One of those twists is that there is item games, to collect items like Boo Bell, to call Boo the ghost, to collect coins or stars from opponents, and the dueling glove. This item you use, you can challenge one opponent to a duel, where you bet your coins for a win. There are six in general, depending on the course your on. Although the games on Mario Party 2 are a little bit harder to control,  it takes a little more time to get used to, especially in some games where the controls are extremely sensitive. Nevertheless, it is just as challenging. Although many places stopped carrying Nintendo 64 games, it is a little bit harder to get games like these. You either are lucky and you find them newly conditioned or used, or you go on a wild goose chase to get a certain kind of game you like. In this case, if you're a fan of the previous Mario Party for Nintendo 64, I suggest you give this one a roll of the dice too.</td><td>A Decent Sequel</td><td>1048204800</td><td>1</td><td>333</td><td>1421</td><td>17</td><td>4.267267267267267</td><td>19.58823529411765</td><td>0.019492373</td><td>536</td></tr><tr><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>12680</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>01 24, 2002</td><td>B0000488VP</td><td>N.

On one hand a game like Majesty is something I buy immediately because it might be great, and on the other hand I've played so many great strategy  games by now that I feel let down when a game isn't fully implemented  properly. You are ... yes ... a ruler of some sort, although they were  nice to make it genderless! It's a building-placing game, where you locate  each new construction site - be it for a Warrior's Guild, a Ranger's Guild,  or so on. You then request for that building to either upgrade new weapons  or items, or recruit named heroes to join your cause. The graphics are  very, very nice, but I've been spoiled in recent years by some of the  amazing graphics from the various games. It's a shame that detailed leaves  on trees and items by the buildings only elicit a \"Jeez, that's  pretty\" instead of amazed appreciation. The named units is a nice  touch - instead of a random ranger exploring, you have Teave Trailblazer  exploring the eastern marches for you. The home building tells you what  each unit is up to, and the units themselves have little thought bubbles  over their heads, a la Dungeon Keeper. The Scottish-lilt voice chimes in  with important information. \"More gold, your majesty\" is a common  call, as your tax collector makes his rounds. Your troops defend your town  from killer plants and rat-men while you build it up. I appreciate that  units should actively roam and defend and right, but really, many strategy  games out there *do* have that ability. In Majesty, it's fun for a while to  set rewards and try to motivate your units, but it can get very old and  frustrating very quickly. Also, the missions are not extremely challenging,  making the game itself a quick play-through. A fun play for its sim-like  qualities, but not a top notch strategy game.</td><td>Intriguing ideas, nice graphics, short life</td><td>961977600</td><td>1</td><td>351</td><td>1527</td><td>23</td><td>4.35042735042735</td><td>15.26086956521739</td><td>0.11584298</td><td>862</td></tr><tr><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>12767</td><td>5.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>03 26, 2012</td><td>B000047GEI</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>In 1998, the Pokemon Craze hit the ground running.  Millions had invested in Gameboys soley because of Pokemon Red and Blue.  Kids were going to school, trading Pokemon and battling one another.  They were getting into arguments over who the best starter was and talking about how to raise the best team.  And, of course, we had to catch them all.  During this time the television show was also surging with popularity.  It got many gamers wondering why the games didn't follow the show?  At the time it hadn't occured to gamers that the Red and Blue versions had been out in Japan long before the show was even established.  A year after Red and Blue had shattered sales records and become one of the biggest selling games of all time, Nintendo decided to release Pokemon Yellow.  Riding off the success of Red and Blue as well as the television show, Pokemon Yellow was a big success.  It sticks closer to the television series, although after a while you pretty much have to settle on the fact that it's still Pokemon. Pokemon Yellow may be closer to the television series, but it doesn't do anything to separate itself from Red and Blue.  By that I mean it starts off in a very similar manner.  You name your character and your rival.  The differences start early on when instead of picking a starter, you set outside of town only to be attacked by a Pikachu.  Professor Oak quickly catches the little guy and gives him to you.  Your rival will always get an Eevee.  In Red and Blue you picked a starter and your rival always picked one as well.  Here you both have a predetermined Pokemon.  The good news is that because Yellow version follows the show you'll eventually get Charmander, Bulbasaur and Squirtle anyway. What was perhaps the strangest thing about Pokemon is that the game was surprisingly deep in terms of combat. It was your traditional turn-based combat. Simple, yet it was so complex. For one, the game has a Rock/Paper/Scissors method to it. Every Pokemon has a type, and every type has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Water is strong up against fire but it is weak vs. Grass. Grass is weak vs. fire etc. etc. No Pokemon is invincible. They all have a weakness to some type. Though in these versions the psychics definitely have an unfair advantage as the type they're weak against (bug) is almost non-existent and there are hardly any bug type attacks. In the battle menu you're given a list of commands. Fight, Item, PKMN, or Run. You can switch Pokemon you've caught in and out of battle on the fly, but it'll usually cost you a turn. It's the strategic portion of Pokemon that makes battling fun and addictive. As you go through the game you'll be challenged by trainers and you never know what they'll throw at you! It's completely unpredictable and some of them are tough. It's also interesting because with 150 different Pokemon, the amount of teams you can make are endless, and it really makes you think about what types you want in your roster. Because most of the Pokemon types are weak vs. more than just one type. It's also important that you give them a variety of moves, as the moves are also typed. On paper it doesn't seem like much, but when you actually play the game, you'll find a clog in your drain you didn't even know you had because you thought your team was perfect... but then that one Pokemon comes along and exposes your fatal flaw. There are other little goodies that are thrown in from the television series for good measure.  For instance you'll fight Jessie and James who each use their respective Pokemon.  You'll also battle Meowth.  Most of what you end up seeing in Pokemon Yellow becomes more of a giant easter egg more than anything.  The route in which you travel through Pokemon Yellow doesn't change at all.  You'll go to the same locations as Red and Blue and in the same order as well.  The difference is that in some places where you'd normally fight individual members of Team Rocket (a set piece battle, that is) you'll fight Jessie and James instead.  It doesn't change things up.  There are, at least, little changes also scattered around.  Certain Pokemon will learn moves at different levels (some of them notably earlier than in Red and Blue).  They might also learn moves they previously couldn't learn at all.  Some stats are also more balanced.  For some it's not a big deal, but for certain Pokemon it changes the dynamic of them.  Pikachu, for instance, will actually learn more attacks than he could in Red and Blue. There are a couple of other things that have changed.  Most notably is that Pikachu actually follows you around and has a mood that helps to decide whether or not Pikachu likes you.  The more he likes you the more likely some denizens will be to give you items.  In the long run there's only one moment where it's crucial for your Pikachu to be happy with you (that being if you want to acquire a Bulbasaur).  Aside from that, how Pikachu views you has no lasting merit.  Likewise, Pikachu refuses to evolve.  Just like in the show.  This means that for the beginning stages of the game, Pikachu is a good Pokemon to have, but in the later half of the game there's no real reason to use Pikachu.  He'll eventually lag in all the areas where your other Pokemon will succeed.  His inability to evolve eventually harms him in the sense that when you're using a Charizard or a Dragonite... they're generally more helpful than your Pikachu in a pinch.  You'll also never actually see a Pikachu in the wild in Pokemon Yellow.  It's strange to say, but the part about Pokemon Yellow that doesn't really stand out is... well... Pikachu.  The novelty of him following you around wears off quickly.  Likewise, so will his moods.  Before long you just start treating him like another Pokemon. That's not to say that Pokemon Yellow is less than Red and Blue.  It's only to suggest that you'd have to REALLY love Pikachu in order to find him to be a unique Pokemon.  Pikachu will also talk and make sounds.  The game was released at the height of the television shows popularity and thus, at the height of Pikachu's popularity.  It has caused some to dismiss Pokemon Yellow as a giant marketing gimmick.  This is especially true if you've got Pokemon Red and Blue.  Pokemon Yellow, like Red and Blue has certain Pokemon that don't appear at all in the version.  The difference is that if Yellow is the only Version you have then you MUST find someone with Red and you MUST find someone with Blue in order to get all 150 Pokemon.  Pokemon Yellow owners have to do a bit more to capture all of the Pokemon where as Red and Blue owners only need to find someone with the opposite color. The famous glitches that were found in Pokemon Red and Blue were fixed and thus they're not in this game.  There is no way to catch Missing No.  There is no easy way to catch Safari Zone Pokemon and there is no way to duplicate Rare Candies etc.  On one hand that glitch was pretty cool to uncover.  On the other hand they were clearly glitches that weren't meant to pop up in the games in the first place.  So it's no big deal. Perhaps the most amusing is how some of the presentation looks.  There isn't much in terms of Color for this game.  It certainly has a palette that matches what your Red and Blue versions look like on the Super Gameboy but never takes full advantage of the color palette like Gold and Silver do later.  On the other hand it is rather nice to see from time to time.  The biggest difference is what some of the Pokemon actually look like.  Certain Pokemon have a different snapshot than they did before.  Some of them looking closer to what you saw in the television series.  So while Pokemon Yellow looks better it certainly doesn't change the fact that certain things aren't so great.  Like Red and Blue your Pokemon only flinch to attack.  We can forgive some of the animations and even the lack of detail in the battles and environments, though.  It is, after all, an 8-bit Gameboy Game. Pokemon Yellow is still a good game.  It's hard to say if it has aged as well as Red and Blue, however.  The television series is way past where Yellow was upon it's release and those who pick up Red or Blue (or both) aren't really going to see any reason to get Yellow when those two versions are all you need to catch them all.</td><td>Gotta Catch 'Em All</td><td>1332720000</td><td>1</td><td>1571</td><td>6760</td><td>113</td><td>4.3029917250159135</td><td>13.902654867256636</td><td>0.08111111</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>12807</td><td>5.0</td><td>87</td><td>false</td><td>06 26, 2000</td><td>B00004DITJ</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I love feudal Japan. I've been editor for a magazine on feudal Japan for over ten years, have made kimono, and love watching Japanese movies for hours and hours. I have the Shogun board game, and play that quite a bit.  Since I review strategy games for BellaOnline. Com, it was a natural for me  to buy Shogun: Total War as soon as it was out. While the box makes it  seem that the game is much like the board game, where you move groups of  units from province to province (a la Risk), the computer game is actually  far more comprehensive and intense. To start with, there are actual  graphics for each member of a unit - it's more like having a set of forces  in Age of Empires II than block-units. While you don't direct the  individuals, they still fight on a one-by-one basis, which leads to  stunning combat sequences when you're in full attack. Back to the  basics, though. The game's graphics are awesome. If this game doesn't  incite you to go buy that P3-750 with a top end sound and graphic card,  nothing will. The rolling hills, wisps of fog floating over the individual  trees, clouds reflected in the smooth stream before you, each unit with his  own armor and banners and colors ... it's stunning. The music is gorgeous  as well. The narrator ... well, he sounds like a Russian citizen trying to  wander around Tokyo. You can't have everything. The tutorials are great.  They do them in standard tutorial fashion, too: give the objectives you'll  learn, step through those lessons, and then recap what you've learned. They  are very helpful, and get you used to unit movements and formations. You  can choose the formation within a unit and of all your units in your attack  force. There are of course different kinds of units - ground troops with  swords, archers, horsemen with spears, and many other combinations. As you  build your fortress you can create buildings for new and interesting troops  as well. Each unit has its own strengths, and its own morale. They work  well on different terrain, and in different weather. Yes, weather affects  troops too! Rain dampens the musketeers, while snow hinders other troops.  Going up or downhill affects troops, and you can hide in the trees. This is  about as close as you can get to some of the historical battles of the  1600s. Speaking of which, in addition to the fully customizable battle  systems, you can fight historical battles as well! Interested in how you  would have fared against some of the great Shogun of Japan? Load up the  battle and find out. Want to kill off a few close friends? You have that  option as well.

Fallout shocked the game community in the late 90's and for a good reason. The game had a mature RPG theme that was rare in the day. The post-apocalyptic theme had a creepy atmosphere, haunting music, and an interesting setting. You are a vault dweller who is coming out of Vault 13 for the first time. You need to get a water chip because the one in your vault has failed. You only have enough for a few months so you have to get one before time runs out in game. When you jump in to create your character is almost exactly like the new games. Pick your two perks, distribute your points among your skills and go. You can choose anywhere from explosives, survival, first aid, big guns, small guns etc. The game is an isometric point-and-click with turn based combat. This had a lot of problems for me. Any actions you use use action points which include opening the inventory, moving, using weapons, and healing. When your points are used the next companion or enemy takes their turn. This is fine and all, but I found issues where I was trying to snipe enemies from afar and companions would wonder off-screen and get into trouble with a pack of enemies and I couldn't manually end the combat. I also found this pace extremely slow and it took forever to move around the small areas. If that doesn't annoy the menu will. To reload weapons you have to open your inventory and drag the right ammo over to the weapon. This uses action points, but this also applies for healing items. You can't put a stack of stimpaks in the inventory, but instead just on at a time. The inventory is just a column that you have to scroll through and you can't organize it. I also hate bartering because if you trade an item that has hundreds or thousands you have to click All which brings the number to 999 then repeat until all the items are over to your side. What crappy design choice is that? There are plenty of weapons in the game that use various ammo types (same as newer Fallouts). You can buy them at random caravans you encounter in the world map or at stores. There are only about 15 locations you can visit, but each is unique and has various side quests. Keeping track of these is impossible because there is no journal to keep track of this. It makes figuring out where to go a pain because you forget some times. The useless map doesn't help because it's just a bunch of dots with no labels. This makes swapping areas confusing because you have no idea where to go. The world map is also not explorable which would have been nice. You just float across an overworld map and run into random encounters. Overall, the game is worth playing for fans of the newer games and want to see the origins. The characters are interesting, and atmosphere is creepy, but the age really shows with terrible 2D graphics, and bad CGI rendered movies.

You begin with a  number of islands on the map, and with your flotilla of boats, you explore  them, learning what each is good at producing. You settle on one, creating  hunting lodges, tobacco plantations, sugar cane, chapels, and homes. Just  as in the Caesar III style of games, there are steps to take to create  products. You take tobacco from the farm and turn it into cigars. Sugar  cane goes to the distillery and becomes alcohol, and the tavern buys it.  You can also establish trade routes. An island low in tobacco can ship that  in, and send off the stones it is mining. Homes develop in size as their  needs are met. Quarry stone for more advanced buildings, and build your  technology for more interesting options. Build up your sheep farm and send  wool to the weaver for more content (and well dressed)  inhabitants. There's combat too - pirates lurk in the seas, and nearby  settlements compete with you for land. You can invade their territory, or  try to outmerchant them. You can even multi-play to take on your friends in  high seas adventure. While this is definitely fun for beginners, it  leaves something to be desired for advanced players. I would recommend this  to a family that wishes to play together, and for gamers new to strategy,  who want to learn at a gentle pace how to manage resources and grow a city.</td><td>Great intro for people new to strategy gaming</td><td>968025600</td><td>1</td><td>289</td><td>1246</td><td>17</td><td>4.311418685121107</td><td>17.0</td><td>0.29539984</td><td>862</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>12890</td><td>4.0</td><td>12</td><td>true</td><td>10 8, 2000</td><td>B00004KD64</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Ground Control always makes me start humming 'Major Tom' - the game itself is quite down to earth, though. The premise is quite interesting. You're a 34 year old senior female military person, working for the Crayven Corporation. The Order is your enemy, and you fight them. That's about all you know as you begin the game. You fight them because you're told to by the cold manager, Enrica Hayes who has no brains and couldn't care why you do what you do. When you get your mission briefings from Enrica, you then get to configure your units with whatever options are available, fill your drop ships, and land to attack. The game works with individuals grouped together into set units. While a set of 4 tanks move together, a particular tank can get wounded and die. You can't tell a particular tank to go somewhere on its own, though. The unit moves together. This makes it easier to manage many missions, simply grabbing units and pointing them in directions. The graphics are great!  Ground Control has the move-anywhere view that Dark Reign 2 uses. Very intuitive and easy to use. Follow along with a unit, or get a birds-eye view of the great graphical combats. While my Athlon-750 often choked on some of the larger scale combats (boding poor results for slower machines), in general it whisked along at a good clip. The landscape is fully three dimensional and fully rendered. Hide in the shadow of a cliff to get an ambush jump on your enemy. Sneak along under trees or overhangings to avoid being seen. Troops have options for weaponry and healing that can be customized. Troops can be carried in APCs to zip from location to location, and peel out quickly into whichever formation you specify. The downsides on the game are the stuttering I mentioned before on heavy-graphic situations, and also the general situation you, Major Sarah Parker, find yourself in. While it's great that the lead player and her boss are both women, it's very, very annoying playing a game in which you watch your 'friends' shoot up hospitals, where you're berated by your commander and where no matter how quickly you get to someone, the program insists it's \"too late\" and you must watch the person die to further the plot. I have enough frustration in real life without playing a game in which the lead character is drinking after each mission, wondering why she even keeps fighting. Does that provide any incentive for the player to want to keep playing? Also, most games of this style allow the player to choose amongst factions and decide which side to play. In this game it's very linear. Each mission is forced on you, and what you do in the mission is pre-set. While replaying the same mission 10 times might have them decide to attack from the NE or the SE randomly, they always attack, and then the same exact messages always appear, which you cannot click through. If you enjoy strategy combat without building units or structures, and have a fast enough machine to handle this, Ground Control might be the perfect game for you!</td><td>Amazing graphics but your system has to handle it</td><td>970963200</td><td>1</td><td>532</td><td>2495</td><td>29</td><td>4.68984962406015</td><td>18.344827586206897</td><td>0.062799565</td><td>862</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>12902</td><td>5.0</td><td>18</td><td>false</td><td>10 17, 2000</td><td>B00004KHB7</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn was a much anticipated game. Most of my friends have played through Baldur's Gate and Sword Coast, as well as PlaneScape Torment, and were waiting anxiously for II to come out. Was it worth the wait? The creators of BG2 have definitely learned from the previous games. The graphics are gorgeous, with a lot of the detailed textures and special effects that we've come to expect. Gameplay is smooth and uses the same interface as the other games - intuitive and easy to learn. You can even hide the interface if you wish. The game carries along the storyline from BG, and you can  import your old characters from the first game. Your friends are still there - even if you happened to kill them off or abandon them in BG. The game developers learned from Planescape - BG2 is very open and epic in feel. None of this linear do-this-now-do-that nonsense. The role play is also great, and the options available to your character at any point are quite comprehensive. Non-player intelligence is boosted in this game - people aren't as likely to get stuck behind a tree or next to a door. In general, BG2 is a great improvement over the original BG, and a worthy follow-up. If you enjoyed Baldur's Gate or Planescape Torment, definitely pick this up and play through. With its higher optional resolutions and enhanced graphics, this also bodes extremely well for the next RP game these guys choose to make!</td><td>A must-buy for any fan of Baldur's Gate!</td><td>971740800</td><td>1</td><td>254</td><td>1177</td><td>15</td><td>4.633858267716535</td><td>16.933333333333334</td><td>0.099517375</td><td>862</td></tr><tr><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>12931</td><td>5.0</td><td>7</td><td>false</td><td>12 23, 2002</td><td>B00004LC81</td><td>N.

For being an 8-bit system, the graphics and sound are simply astounding, and the controls are exact and dead on.  Stealth is still the name of the game and you'll have to dodge guards and security cameras to complete your mission, plus VR missions and cut scenes are here as well, making this game play so unbelieveably close to it's PS1 counterpart that many a gamer will be left in awe when they see it in action.  The storyline is a prequel to the PS1 game that would set up the events that take place in that game, and while it may start out as a run of the mill story, it quickly picks up and by the time you finish the game you'll be catching your breathe.

The graphics are still as awe inspiring as they were on it's 32-bit cousin, and the control is even tighter utilizing all of the DC controler's capabilities.  Not to mention that this game featured some of the finest voice acting to ever grace a video game; the cut scenes are seamlessly done and it's almost like a graphic novel come to life.  All in all, if you've never played the first Soul Reaver game you are sadly missing out.  It is better than last year's sequel, and if you own a Dreamcast it is a must own.

In fact, its pretty much an interactive movie with over an hour of dramatic cinemas, but thats a good thing.  The storyline is quite possibly the best I've ever heard of in a video game, revolving around a mercenary named Guts who is desperate to find a cure for his lover Casca who is suffering from a disease leaving her with the mind of a child, and is accompinied by a naked flying elf named Puck.  There is a disease in the village that causes people to have the same symptoms Casca has, but I won't spoil any more surprises from there.  Guts carries with him a sword called Dragon Slayer, which measures taller than Guts, and when you fight hordes and hordes of enemies, you learn why he is called Guts in the first place.  It's simple hack and slash action with a superb storyline (based on a Japanese manga), incredible graphics (rivaling those of Code: Veronica, Alone in the Dark, and Sonic), and some of the best game music you'll ever hear.

The graphics are so superb and meticulous attention is paid to every detail imaginable.  The voice acting is rather well done too, although some of the voices sound rather sarcastic and like they're hiding something.  The controls will take some time getting used to, but once you do you'll be loving Shenmue.  This massive game was originally the first of many chapters, but Shenmue 2 has been cancelled for the US Dreamcast (a shame) so this is a true gem.  By the way, there is nothing better than being able to play the original versions of Space Harrier (an all time favorite of mine), and Hang On (even though the controls for it are rather sensitive), and the other arcade games are fun too.

While I could never seem to find the first one, I managed to find this one.  While I liked WA3 a lot, this one wasn't as good I thought.  True the gameplay elements are top-notch and all, but where it gets annoying are the themes outside the gameplay. First of all, these characters are actually nicely developed. Something that I didn't very much expect from this game. They were brilliantly done.  However, the dialogue was a little annoying at times. There was one NPC character that always started every sentence off with \"In my humble opinion\" and that got very annoying at the beginning of the game because I ran into him a lot.  The dialogue was also weak and didn't get the storyline across fast enough. The graphics aren't very good for the PSX. This was made in 2000 and we were looking at games like FFIX and LOD then and these graphcis couldn't compare. They're fuzzy. While they aren't that bad, I wasn't quite used to that. The other major gripe (and the reason I gave it three stars) is the music.  The music is by far some of the worst I've heard in an RPG. Seems kind of stupid to dislike the music huh? In an RPG you have to realize that you may need to endure some music for hours.  The music in this was enough to make my ears explode! The other reason I gave this three stars is because the most important element to me was a little shabby. That's storyline.  There was a story in this game but it was slow and boring to get to.  The story paced so slowly and I couldn't take it! I was a little disappointed in this game but it really wasn't all that bad. But the music and storyline...something I have to deal with throughout the entire game, were overall weak.  So to be truthful this game isn't the most worthwhile in the bunch but for any RPGer its very promising because of gameplay this game is easily a good one to choose. The good +Great gameplay +Good battle system +Character development +Not a bad story although... The bad -Story moves very slowly -Music is annoying! -The graphics aren't the best.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>In a world where there were CDs, companies like Sega and 3DO had tried to capitalize on the concept of playing video games on a CD, giving the games enhanced graphics and sound. There is one company, however, named Nintendo, and it created Donkey Kong Country. Donkey Kong Country was a game that proved that you don't need CD-based technology to make games with flashy graphics. You just need to put in effort to fit it to your console. And years went by, it was ported to the 8-Bit Game Boy Color. Did it make the transition well? Well, the Donkey Kong Land games were great, so maybe this one would be good. DKC's graphics were incredible on the Super Nintendo. The game almost looked like the characters came from a CGI movie. At least, at its time. Even the backgrounds had tons of details and neat movements. Here, on the Game Boy Color, the graphics are still very colorful and greatly detailed. The sounds and music were memorable. Even when you defeat a Kremling (alligator enemy), his voice effect when he dies will always be remembered for a long time. As for the music, well, you can never go wrong with the sweet beats of Kongo Jungle and the King K. Rool boss battle. The game is one of those games that show the characters on a map before actually going into the levels. Once you go to a level, you're gonna be expecting barrel-blasting, Kremling-smashing, animal-romping fun! There is a lot to do in Donkey Kong Country. As a platformer, it doesn't disappoint with its gameplay. You can even find and play as an Animal Buddy, like a rhino or an ostrich. Rhinos can knock everybody out of its way, while the Ostrich guides you safely across the level. It can also float in the air like Racoon Mario in Super Mario Bros 3. The entire game is a bunch of fun. Unlike the original Super Nintendo version, this game can save anytime. So where does that lead Candy's Save Point to? It just so turns out that it became a bonus game area. Thank god you can now autosave. I kinda don't like having to struggle through a level just to get to the save point. Either I have to reach there or lose all of my lives. Now that that's out of the way, I can save the trouble for hard levels easily. Overall, this is a really great Game Boy Color game.

Not much plot, but who cares, basically you play an angry teenager skating around spraypainting public property and outrunning and outmanuvering the cops while doing it.  After the first real mission, the game gets downright addicting and even more fun than before, something SEGA is great at doing with most of their in-house developed games.  The soundtrack is surprisingly decent too even though I'm not into hip-hop at all, tracks from Rob Zombie, Cold, and Professional Murder Music add to the replay value. The only problem with Jet Grind Radio is that there is no multi-player internet mode which would have made this the greatest game ever made, but thats only a minor gripe.

The game starts off after the first game but know you awaken again to fight the same evil as before. The graphics and audio in this game are top-notch, and while MediEvil II was developed late in the PS1's life cycle it doesn't disappoint. You have plenty of weapons and different ways to solve puzzles such as using Dan's head, torches etc. The combat is pretty simple with the smashing of X while you can strafe with R1 or charge up your hits with square. While the combat gets very repetitive it's the least of ME2's problems. The main problem comes into the extremely frustrating and almost impossible platforming sections. The developers made the spaces between platforms so far apart that it requires extreme precision. This doesn't help when you have to double tap a direction to make Dan run and when he does jump it's not that far. This snowballs into badly placed checkpoints (actually none at all!) and if you don't have any extra life bottles (which are scarce) you have to start all over again. The only thing that keeps you from tossing the game at the wall are the short levels. Each one can be completed in about twenty minutes or so depending on if you can complete the puzzle/bosses with the little to no hints the game gives you. If you can look past these major faults you will enjoy ME2's funny humor and excellent voice acting (which was rare back then) so pick this up in your bargain bin next time you're out.</td><td>A funny romp is hurt by troubled platforming segments</td><td>1332979200</td><td>0</td><td>320</td><td>1472</td><td>14</td><td>4.6</td><td>22.857142857142858</td><td>-8.9285715E-4</td><td>471</td></tr><tr><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>13779</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>12 9, 2002</td><td>B00004SA3J</td><td>N.

The Dreamcast VMU (Visual Memory Unit) is a step ahead in designing home system memory cards. Included is a small LCD screen with working buttons to play mini-games along with other features (for example raising Chaos in Sonic Adventure or playing a Pac-Man type game with Namco Museum). You can take the top off the VMU and transfer files into another VMU or link it up to play mini-games together. The VMU can hold up to 200 blocks of memory, and while this may seem like a lot, most of Sega's 2K2 sports titles take just about 200 blocks of memory just to save options let alone a team season. Not to mention that after a while the battery life of the VMU LCD screen will die, and that happens quicker than expected, but the LCD screen isn't necessarily needed if your just using the VMU as a memory card and nothing more. All in all, I would recommend at least 3 or 4 VMU's for Dreamcast owners; they're cheap and affordable and you can still find them at game retailers.</td><td>The best memory card yet, in different colors</td><td>1039392000</td><td>1</td><td>211</td><td>935</td><td>8</td><td>4.431279620853081</td><td>26.375</td><td>-0.0125</td><td>805</td></tr><tr><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>13818</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>01 10, 2014</td><td>B00004SPW9</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>In the year 2000, Squaresoft was pretty much at the top of its game.  In that year they had a string of successes with games like Chrono Cross, Legend of Mana and Final Fantasy IX all dropping by for some time.  Strangely enough one of the most overlooked games during that time was a little gem called Vagrant Story.  Helmed by Yasumi Matsuno (better known as the mind behind Final Fantasy Tactics), it was a game that he knew from the moment it came out would only appeal to a particular crowd.  Vagrant Story wasn't for everyone.  Indeed, many a gamer either couldn't get into it or downright hated it.  Those who did get into it, however, fell in love with the game.  Matsuno has always had that \"You'll love it or hate it,\" appeal.  This may also be because Matsuno's approach to designing a game has always been \"different\" than the typical developer.  There's no game in Matsuno's library that is as complex as Vagrant Story, however.  If you can get into it it's a rewarding and challenging experience.  Patience is required but for the time of its release it was probably one of the most reaching and original games out there. Vagrant Story is set in Valendia.  A cult lead by a man named Sydney have abducted the Duke's son and taken him to the abandoned city of Lea Monde.  As Ashley Riot, your job is to infiltrate the city, find the Duke's son and stop the evil cultists.  Throughout the journey you'll also run into the Crimson Blades who are also out to stop Sydney for their own reasons.  As Ashley enters the city of Lea Monde he gets caught up in a game of cat and mouse with Sydney, who has a mysterious power to see into the past of his victims.  As you play through the game there are many moments of betrayal and characters out to serve their own ends.  It seems like a simple story at first, but as you dive deeper in it becomes more complex and engaging.  Though there are moments when it's slow, Vagrant Story isn't exactly long enough to mind some of its pacing problems, the likes of which are slowed down less by the actual progression of the story and more by the actual gameplay itself. In the year 2000 most JRPGs were the same old typical turn based stuff.  Allies lined up on one side, the enemy on the other.  Vagrant Story does away with that.  Instead it takes on a more active approach to its combat.  You can walk around in normal mode or battle mode.  In normal mode your weapon is sheathed, as is your shield.  In Battle Mode you are ready for combat at any time.  Enemies roam around the map freely.  Vagrant Story fashions itself as a dungeon crawler.  Many dungeons are quite big.  When you enter a room there are usually two or three enemies.  When you engage them in combat you must bring up a battle sphere (referred to as a matrix).  Upon doing so you can select a different part of the body to attack.  Either their right arm, left arm, legs, body or head.  Each one affects different stats in some way and has its own HP listing.  For instance, if you keep attacking an enemies legs you'll reduce their movement.  Keep attacking their primary arm and their attack goes down.  Keep attacking the head and they'll eventually be silenced.  Keep attacking the body and their defenses drop. You can also chain together attacks by setting them to different buttons.  The more you chain attacks together the greater damage you'll do.  Some chain abilities are designed for damage output but others are designed to restore HP or MP while others may silence or paralyze an opponent.  Chain attacks take time to master, however.  Each time your weapon strikes an enemy you have a brief second to hit a button.  If your timing is correct Ashley winds up for another strike.  Hit the button too early or too late and the chain stops.  While it's easy to chain attacks together, the game makes sure you don't take advantage of it by giving you a stat known as Risk.  When your Risk is low your is high and you take less damage.  As your Risk increases your accuracy drops and you take more damage.  On the other hand Risk does have its upsides.  You have a better chance of landing critical strikes and your healing magic will heal far more HP.  So you can take your chances.  Your accuracy is lower but your damage output (if you hit) is higher.  You take more damage but you can also recover more damage. There are also defense abilities at play that work exactly as you think.  When an enemy strikes you, just hit the button corresponding to the defense ability set to it and Ashley defends himself.  As with chain abilities the timing is important.  Some defense abilities allow you to reflect damage, others let you absorb HP and others are just meant to help your defense against certain elemental attacks. Vagrant Story has a deeper system than most games and we've only scratched the surface of what it is.  Certainly there are also various magic spells but they're used in the standard fare you would imagine them to be used in.  First you use a grimoire and then Ashley will master the spell.  Some require specific targeting but for the most part there's little complex about using magic in Vagrant Story.  What is complex, however, is keeping so many things in the background in mind.  For instance, every enemy has a class they fall into.  Human, Dragon, Beast, Phantom, Undead or Evil.  And they're all weak to a very specific weapon type.  We're not talking swords or anything like that.  We're talking either edged, blunt or piercing weapons.  Likewise, you also must pay attention to the elemental affinity of a weapon you're using.  Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Evil and Light.  It seems like a lot to take in at first... and it very much is.  Using the right weapon against an enemy makes the difference between dealing a lot of damage or dealing no damage at all. The good news is that all of this can easily be manipulated through the games various systems.  You might start with a sword that doesn't deal a lot of damage to humans at all... but the more you use it the better it will be against human type enemies.  You can raise any weapons attack against a certain class just by using it on that class.  Thus, you do more damage the more you use a weapon.  Likewise, as you go through the game you'll find various gems to attach to a weapon as well to help improve how much damage you can do to a class.  Some enemies have elemental weaknesses as well which you can also attach gems to your weapon to exploit.  It's not just your weapons, but your shields as well.  You can easily attach a gem to a shield to improve your defenses against various classes and affinities as well.  All this amounts to a fairly complex game when you consider all of this.  But it also means that you'll find yourself constantly micromanaging throughout your journey.  You'll enter one dungeon where a weapon you've obtained and attached gems to works really well only to enter another dungeon where you have to change all of it.  It is certainly possible to go through Vagrant Story with just a single weapon, but you'll feel the need to change it up eventually.  Not only do all those class and affinity matches matter, but eventually you'll want a weapon made out of a different material as well.  You start with a lot of Bronze and Iron stuff that affects class and affinity damage, but you'll also find yourself using better material later that deals greater damage with little or no penalties at all. Vagrant Story is actually a game that, if you grind enough, can be really balanced with its complex weapon system.  Every weapon has the ability to grow its class and affinity damage.  And wouldn't you know it, Vagrant Story makes sure you CAN do this.  Later in the game you'll come across various workshops that will allow you to make and combine your own weapons.  You could easily make a weapon that deals heavy damage to every class and affinity type in the game.  It takes a lot of grinding, but it can happen. What's nice, however, is that outside of the boss encounters the game isn't too punishing.  If an enemy is weaker to a blunt type weapon but you prefer your edge type the damage isn't nearly as well affected as your class and affinity are.  Even so, however, there are lots of spells that can be used to boost any affinity you're lacking or that can be used to strengthen your attacks and equipment.  Likewise, you'll have plenty of spells that can decrease your enemies stats as well. Unlike most games, Vagrant Story wants you to learn and utilize every bit of its system.  Particularly in its boss encounters where knowing the class and elemental affinity of your opponent is your key to victory.  Vagrant Story is a challenging game, but only to those who do not understand the mechanics of the system.  If you're fighting a water elemental enemy for instance, just boosting your attack and casting a spell that boosts your weapons fire affinity (as well as having the proper gems) will save the day.  If, however, you're not willing to micro manage and prepare for each boss, Vagrant Story is more than happy to punish you for it.  This is not a game where just knowing the basics will help you succeed.  This is a game that expects you to actually learn and utilize the system at play and isn't going to hold your hand to get you there.  If you aren't willing to read the game's instruction manual (or willing to read the Quick Manual in the game itself) then you'll find Vagrant Story to be a challenging and frustrating endeavor.  If, however, you spend the time to learn the complexities of the system, Vagrant Story is surprisingly easy.  The most challenging boss won't be a match if you understand what to do. About the only thing that might hold you up is that Vagrant Story is large and sprawling.  The dungeons are huge, but more than that, the game isn't always telling you where to go next.  You'll often come across locked doors that you need to have a certain key or sigil for.  And when you get that key or sigil you'll need to find the door itself.  The good news is that while the game won't guide you back there, it has lots of tools to give you an idea of where you can or cannot go.  Each sigil has flavor text that tells you which dungeon it can be used it while the in game map always marks locked and unlockable doors for you.  Again, if you're not willing to utilize the system you'll be hopelessly lost.  You may still get lost, however.  While you'll know which doors can and cannot be passed through thanks to your map, the game still doesn't tell you WHERE you need to go a lot of the time.  There's a lot to explore in Lea Monde at least.  It's a huge game where there are lots of things to do off the beaten path.  Going back to old dungeons and grabbing equipment from otherwise locked chests or rooms is nice.  It's a shame, however, that most of Vagrant Story's best optional content is saved for after completing your journey.  Much of what you do must be done in a New Game+.  Many of the optional bosses and optional dungeons can only be played on replay.  While this sounds like a chore at first, it's remarkable how fast Vagrant Story moves.  Your first play through may take a moment because you're getting lost, but once you've experienced it once you'll come to learn that Vagrant Story is a pretty short game.  In a New Game+ you'll find these new areas pretty quickly and they'll keep you busy for a while. Vagrant Story is close to perfect for its design.  For everything that seems like it'll give you trouble there is an opposite solution that will always work for you.  However, beyond its complexities what you realize is that Vagrant Story is most certainly not for the fast paced gamer.  It's short, but it won't feel short the first time through.  The battle system will make everything feel slow.  The combat always stops so that your enemies can cast spells and in some cases this is a lot.  Combat may seem very active, but at some point it's the same turn based affair you've always known.  But when enemies and characters take certain action everything stops while it's being executed.  This is not an action/adventure RPG, it's very much just an RPG.  In moments where all you want to do is get through the dungeon without engaging your enemies in combat this is particularly annoying as you'll always be stopped so they can have their attack.  Likewise, as a result of this you'll often have to stop and take a moment to heal any sustained damage.  While it's nice that your HP and MP will regenerate in normal mode, enemies are going to do damage quite fast when you're not interrupting their blows with your own (and even the normal enemies can do quite a bit of damage). Other times Vagrant Story can feel downright unfair.  When I mention about having to really prepare for boss fights or else the game will punish you?  I'm not joking.  There will be bosses that, without the right preparation will take you down with a single cast of a spell.  Other times enemies will employ some strangely strategic tactics to make sure you don't stand a chance.  If you aren't willing to utilize the tools the game gives you it's not going to be a rewarding experience.  In an interview Matsuno described the game as being for \"hardcore\" players (a definition that has certainly changed from what Matsuno meant then) and he is certainly correct in that regard.  Vagrant Story is a game that the player can't hope to succeed in without fully understanding the systems at play, and the learning curve is a pretty steep one.  Many video games really ease you into things and make things quite easy in the event that not everything clicks for you immediately.  Vagrant Story knows no such forgiveness.  As such many a gamer is probably turned away from Vagrant Story because of its complexities.  There are a lot of things to keep track of, a lot of micromanaging to do and a lot of preparation that comes before every boss at a certain point.  All this culminates into what is still widely seen as a very complex game.  In some instances, without the aid of a walkthrough (at least for bosses) Vagrant Story can appear to be needlessly challenging without understanding the fundamentals of the game. Even for hardcore players, however, some of the micromanaging can be a bit much.  There will be stretches where you'll feel like you're spending more time in the menu than actually exploring and playing the game.  As you use various weapons and grow fond of a favorite this will ease off, but until that point Vagrant Story is pretty strict about it's combat system and is surprisingly meticulous.  There isn't room for a lot of error and sometimes this can be grating to those new to Vagrant Story.  Even intimidating at times.  Many of Square's other games are far more accessible than Vagrant Story. As I said, however, once learned Vagrant Story is a surprisingly easy game.  In fact, it can be a little too easy to get overpowered when you realize just how combining weapons and raising affinities really works.  So much so that it can be really easy to take advantage of it.  Once you know what class and affinity you're dealing with Vagrant Story is a pushover.  To make sure you can't get too overpowered, Vagrant Story has limited inventory space.  You can't simply run around with all your weapons.  Eventually your weapon inventory gets full and you'll be forced to dump a few in a container.  The same goes for armor and other items.  It surprisingly balances the game, but once again, can be a big hassle for those who aren't particularly big on micromanagement. As far as Playstation games go, Vagrant Story was among the best looking ones out there.  Certainly games like Chrono Cross look a little better, but Vagrant Story, especially for all it does at a time, is quite a good looking game for its time.  The art style is very nice.  What really makes it work is the tone that goes along with everything.  It's a very dramatic story.  The dialog is some of the best written in any game Square has ever published.  The presentation is just overall very nice.  The dark and dreary tone is enhanced by the soundtrack which is just as magical, dramatic and dark as the game itself.  Everything about the presentation gives you an idea as to what kind of world you're stepping into.  This isn't a lighthearted fantasy.  A great deal of JRPGs have a tendency to go the more adolescent or more juvenile route with a lot of themes and intrigue, but Vagrant Story doesn't do any such thing.  Many characters are put in situations that feel hopeless at times.  It's a dark story filled with betrayal and political intrigue and it will shove this in your face.  And there are A LOT of politics in Vagrant Story.  And the deeper you dive into the story, the more interesting it gets as revelations are unveiled and character motivations come to light. Vagrant Story is not a game for everyone.  It simply is not.  It's complexities and micromanagement systems can make the experience tedious for some players, while others may be turned away by how difficult the game will be without understanding them--especially because the game will punish you for neglecting to learn any of it.  This isn't a game where you learn the basics and keep going.  This is a game where you MUST dig into the systems and the mechanics because it's unrelenting if you don't.  However, those willing to dive and learn the system will see a Playstation game unlike any other they've ever experienced.  With a great story, some great localization and a very creative battle system, Vagrant Story is a hidden treasure.  It may not be simple and it may not fashion itself approachable, but the more you get to know it, the more charming it becomes.</td><td>Magical In So Many Ways</td><td>1389312000</td><td>1</td><td>3345</td><td>14394</td><td>194</td><td>4.303139013452915</td><td>17.242268041237114</td><td>0.1128927</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>13949</td><td>5.0</td><td>78</td><td>false</td><td>12 18, 2006</td><td>B00004SQPD</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>With all the hype about the PS3, Wii and XBox 360, take another look at the PS2. It has a huge library of games, a reliable system, and is inexpensive! The PS2, which launched in December 2001, uses DVDs as its storage medium, meaning the unit can double as a CD and DVD player. It is small, light for carrying around, and doesn't have the sound or heat problems that the 360 and PS3 have. It's extremely sturdy - we have two PS2s and haven't had any problems with either one. The graphics on the PS2 are very impressive, especially some of the later games where the game designers had years to learn how to take advantage of every last detail in the system's design. For a long while the XBox had a clear advantage with graphics, but with some of the recent releases, like Final Fantasy XIII, the cut scenes were just gorgeous. Speaking of Final Fantasy, with the PS2 you can play all games from the PS2 *and* PS1 series - meaning you can play every Final Fantasy game that is out. That alone could keep you occupied for months if not years. Guitar Hero is another fantasic game that is only on the PS2. The guitar controllers literally cannot plug into a PS3. Here's a pretty clear indicator of how good the PS2 system is. We've had the XBox 360 for a year, and got the Wii and PS3s right when they came out. Even so, we were still going back to our PS2 to play the games we had on it, rather than bother with moving our save games up to the PS3. The games were really that good. Sometimes it's not about high def super graphics. Sometimes it's about pure, fun gameplay. The PS2 has perfected that over the years, and there are numerous games on this system that have legions of fans. There's even a network port if you want to play online. Note that it doesn't have \"built in wireless\" - you have to plug a bridge or other wireless adaptor into the port to have it connect to your home wireless network. This is really easy to do, though, and I have full instructions if you need them.

Sony definitely catapulted their way nearly a decade ago with the successful Playstation system. It really became the very first system to really push the limits of the CD-ROM technology, where other systems like Sega CD, Saturn and Dreamcast have failed. Now what was then, still remains as now. The Sony Playstation 2, is a much more powerful video game system that really delivers. This smaller, thinner edition of the PS2, absolutely delivers to where other CD-ROM systems have fizzled. The video game system doubles up very nicely as a DVD Player, for all your movie watching need for films of all kinds. The game library remains absolutely endless for so many video gamers of all kinds that you can play here like Jax II, the reved up Gran Turismo 4, Madden '06, the highly acclaimed Reseident Evil 4, and many others. You also can play games on this system with the backwards compatability from the earlier PS1 pr PSX.  The control of the system is also as unique and similar to the previous edition, but it is very simple to respond, and easy to use for all gamers. All in all, with all the hype for the next generation consoles like the Xbox 360, and the Nintendo Revolution, the Playstation 2 by Sony is a absolute delight for all gamers of all kinds. Even though I actually don't own a PS2, I've played it enough from friends and relatives to know that this game system is a really big bundle of fun. I absolutely recommend this video game system.

Just pick this thing up and you'll marvel how Sony ever managed to shrink down the PS2 in size and keep virtually all it's features intact.  Just about everything from the original model PS2 is still here, including the features to play old PS1 games and DVD's, as well as a built in modem for online play.  The long abandoned Firewire port is not here, as well as the plug in for the PS2 HDD hard disc drive, which as a previous reviewer mentioned, will likely never be supported by Sony again outside of the Final Fantasy Online failure.  The sliding disc door, which was subject to malfunctions, is also gone here, replaced with a top loading feature.  As for the system itself as a whole, the PS2 stood as the best home gaming console on the market a few years back, but things have changed.  These days, that claim can't be so sure.  Sure, the graphics aren't as superb as they are on Microsoft's XBox, and the online play can't compare to that of the XBox Live either, but the system's exclusive library of game's were at one time second to none.  Since then, Rockstar's controversial Grand Theft Auto series found it's way to the XBox, and some of the past few first party games, particularly the sports titles, have dwindled in quality.  Right now, Microsoft's money making machine has the advantage, but with the upcoming next-gen systems set to flood the market next year, who knows who will come out on top.  That aside, if you have yet to purchase a current console system, the PS2 is an excellent choice to purchase, considering that the system has a huge library of games and possibly the most third party support of any system today.  So if you're looking to buy a current system, you really can't go wrong with this super sleek, newly designed PS2.</td><td>Gaming excellence, made smaller</td><td>1127865600</td><td>1</td><td>337</td><td>1496</td><td>13</td><td>4.439169139465875</td><td>25.923076923076923</td><td>0.15210292</td><td>805</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>14023</td><td>1.0</td><td>9</td><td>false</td><td>11 25, 2010</td><td>B00004SVMX</td><td>Ryan Sil.

It's rather sad I'm afraid.  Not sad as in tearful necessarily, but in a life-changing and tragic kind of way.  When I was a kid in the late 80's my mom took me to either Sears or Woolworth in Delaware so we could purchase a video game.  At the time I thought Bionic Commando looked kind of cool from the little bit of information I knew about it based on gaming magazines and perhaps even word of mouth.  To my surprise the game was actually available so we purchased it, bring it home, I pop it into the NES... and it doesn't work.  All that appears is a black screen.  I had this same issue with another game at a yard sale called Marble Madness and when I took it back they allowed me to trade it for Robocop.  Good trade there, however... Despite doing everything in my power to get Bionic Commando to work that one summer afternoon, it does not.  A brand new game popped in the NES but the black screen wouldn't go away no matter how hard I try.  When I take it back... I decide to get another game... and the game I get is Yoshi (a puzzle game).  No, not Yoshi's Cookie- just Yoshi.  A Tetris-like puzzle game.  I think this deserves a big \"AHHH WHAT WAS I THINKING?!?!\" moment!  Seriously, Yoshi instead of Bionic Commando?  *smacks self really hard* Anyway, it's now a quarter of a century later and I'm getting to know Bionic Commando for real this time.  I'm actually rather surprised at a couple things.  First I thought the game was more open world than it really is.  The areas look much smaller now compared to 25 years ago obviously, but I really thought the levels were huge even back in the day.  The game doesn't really deliver much concerning a feeling of exploration, but what it DOES do exceptionally well is provide a slice of shooting, bionic arm swinging entertainment that made me realize why I wanted this game so much back in the day- it's unique.  Swinging from platform to platform instead of jumping on them like in every other game was an original idea that undoubtedly influenced Nintendo to create the same concept with the grapple hook in Super Metroid a few years later. Simply put, swinging from your bionic arm all over the place (at fairly good speed too, which is another surprise) and shooting the bad guys is absolutely fun.  There's a LOT of strategy involved in finding the right ways to swing your bionic arm.  Sometimes the path isn't always clear whether it be up, down left or right which requires the player to give the game a strategic approach in order to succeed.  You have to look thoroughly at your surroundings sometimes and be a little creative in order to get around.  This isn't always easy however, since even when you do eventually find the right way to travel there's a severe threat of danger around many corners (usually gunfire).  Be alert when you play this game. At least you're given up to 6 hits (the green bars you see in the top left corner) before you lose a life.  Each hit takes away one bar. Your life bar builds slowly throughout the game.  Also ALWAYS collect the 1-ups for goodness sake!  They help a lot.  Also notable is that there's other games such as a top/down view involving your character moving upwards towards the destination shooting everyone in sight (this one's fun but somewhat repetitive since it's frequent and doesn't offer much in the way of variety), the ability to choose where you want to go on the map screen, and the many battles with the superweapon which is basically the games occasional boss fight.  The battle is always the same however the danger surrounding it increases and changes as you progress, as does the challenge level, so these fights don't feel repetitive at all. And I absolutely LOVE the melodic heroic music that makes up many of the theme songs.  Okay so the bionic arm swinging concept wasn't fully utilized or maybe it was and the limited space of the NES cartridge assured the game had to be short, but who cares seriously.  This game's awesome and just downright fun to play.  The storyline that involves saving a commando is memorable since the characters in this game are actually full of personality which isn't something I can say about most NES games.  The text is readable and memorable too.  I highly recommend picking this game up.  It's better than Yoshi, haha! Oh and before I forget to mention it- if you like this game, I seriously recommend another NES title called P.O.W. (Prisoners of War).  While that game is significantly easier than Bionic Commando and doesn't contain as much exploration (or the bionic arm) it's equally fun and satisfies your desire for gun shooting action and adventure in the same way as Bionic Commando.</td><td>commanding excellence</td><td>1406419200</td><td>0</td><td>873</td><td>3819</td><td>55</td><td>4.374570446735395</td><td>15.872727272727273</td><td>0.03492994</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>14130</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>07 27, 2014</td><td>B00004SVS9</td><td>Bryan</td><td>I'm somewhat surprised this NES version of Metal Gear isn't more well known considering the many innovative features it offered for its day.  You'd think Metal Gear Solid fans would flock to this game at least to see what it's like.  To answer your question, no, this is *nowhere* as compelling as the Metal Gear Solid series.  I think we can all agree with that.  However despite that, what this game does pretty well is provide a relatively short stealth/puzzle-based experience. It's about Solid Snake who has to find and destroy the Metal Gear itself.  Now given this is an NES game, you can imagine simple moves and small areas is what dominates the gameplay, right?  Yup.  However it's surprising to me that the enemies are usually able to detect Snake better than I realized.  I actually think the enemy's ability to detect Snake is better here than in the very first MGS for the Playstation.  I remember several times in MGS it was almost comical to be standing right in front of a guard and somehow he's unable to spot Snake.  Well the same happens here but not as often.  Anyway in this NES Metal Gear game, if you're spotted by guards you will more likely than not find yourself surrounded by many guards that come charging at you from off-screen.  Be prepared to battle hard if you're caught! Basically throughout the game you have to collect card keys, several of them in fact that can be used over and over for a variety of doors, to open new areas while using stealth moves to bypass guards and rescue kidnapped people who provide enough helpful advice to make the adventure at least a little memorable.  You're mostly restricted to the inside of a nuclear facility 90% of the time, and the only times you roam around outside are to find your way to more enemy-filled facility rooms that progress the gameplay by way of collecting familiar items.  I'm shocked the list of collectible items is so gigantic which includes goggles, rations, cardboard boxes, gas masks, flashlights and more.  The gun variety is pretty amazing considering this is an NES game.  Machine guns, rocket launchers, handguns and when all else fails, Snake's trusty punching moves which are quite handy (no pun intended) believe it or not.  I don't support punching dogs though.  Bad Snake! I wish that 97% of the music wasn't the same theme song, but it's a decent/suspenseful one at least.  The boss variety is plain.  You fight a guy with a flame thrower, a tank, a maniac standing behind tied-up kidnapped victims and not really much else.  There's expanding/disappearing floors you have to contend with, and several connections to the Playstation's Metal Gear Solid involving properly lining up and using guided missiles to explode new areas.  Of course do NOT expect a lengthy elaborate storyline.  The text is very simple and straight forward here, with simple commands on your radio frequency and bland characters that only serve to help Snake get from point A to point B.  Nothing particularly inspiring here.  I do strongly recommend using an online FAQ for the elevator rooms because in these particular rooms you're given the option to take Snake to four different hallways which can get pretty confusing in a hurry concerning where you need to go. Overall, well truthfully this game can get boring after a while because the entire facility is basically one big puzzle and you need to use your smarts to figure out how to use the items you acquire.  The enemies are unthreatening for the most part if you're smart with your rations so there's no concern there.  Replay value?  Not really I'm afraid.  Maybe you'll want to play through this game once or twice but probably no more than that.  However for a taste of the stealth aspect that has now made the Metal Gear Solid series so wonderful, it's interesting to see a sneak preview of a similar type of gameplay on the NES.  Still a decent game but more memorable for what it went on to influence.</td><td>beginning gears</td><td>1406419200</td><td>0</td><td>715</td><td>3232</td><td>33</td><td>4.520279720279721</td><td>21.666666666666668</td><td>0.06319867</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>14141</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>11 11, 2006</td><td>B00004SVRQ</td><td>Bryan</td><td>I think the NES version of the Little Mermaid is *extremely* fun.

But if you're not an old-skool gamer or you're just so much more impressed with all the new stuff then you might as well skip this. Let me say that a game shouldn't be judged based on it's age, graphics and sound alone.  This game taught me that the importance of a game was it's gameplay and that my friends is what this game is all about. First let me say this though, there was one moment in this game that made me realize that games are meant to be explored, and you know what that is? That invisible block in the first level! When I first found that invisible block I was in awe because it was in the middle of NO WHERE but just appeared.  I actually let that one-up get away the first time. I'd never seen anything like it before in ANYTHING! Now I know that people complain, \"Oh you can't save\" and \"You only get three lives and when you die you start from the beginning\" and \"There's a @#$%^&* time limit!\" and of course everyone's favorite \"These graphics suck\" and second favorite \"The game is too short\".  Well, as I said it isn't the age that counts.  For it's time these graphics were some of the best the world had ever seen!  Also, the ability to save your game wasn't in thought yet (Metroid was one of the first games to even use the \"Password\" system).  You got three lives on just about EVERY game back then and as I said, saving hadn't been thought of.  The lentgh? You certainly wouldn't think so now but Super Mario was one of the longest games in the world when it was released! For today's standards the difficulty has gone down (but I'd still say it's easier than the majority of XBOX, PS2 and GCN games) but not by much.  The game can still be hard but it's easy to master. In fact this game started a series of Video Game challenges in which people did crazy things like go through the entire game without grabbing a single mushroom on one life WITHOUT warping! I remember doing that as well. For the ages this game is freakishly awesome.  Even those born in my time would know this game pretty well and have fun with it (Some of us were like what...one? two? three? etc.?) Truly if you're an NES fanatic and an old-skool gamer this is one game you CANNOT be without!</td><td>WOW!</td><td>1064188800</td><td>1</td><td>472</td><td>1967</td><td>22</td><td>4.1673728813559325</td><td>21.454545454545453</td><td>0.020549837</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>14259</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>11 19, 2010</td><td>B00004SVV7</td><td>Ryan Sil.

Two years later, Nintendo created the NES and, along with Super Mario Bros, it saved the gaming industry. Super Mario Bros is a terrific NES game that would always remain fun until the day we die. The gameplay is what you would expect from a 2D Mario game: Collecting powerups, top-notch platforming, coins, enemies, etc... The graphics were good at the time. The sounds and music were great, especially at the time. To think some of those noises became iconic ones in Nintendo's world of games. The game is pretty long: You have to go through 8 worlds (4 levels in each) and, if you want, do the harder quest, which replaces Goombas with Buzzy Beetles.

It's strictly about solving puzzles while roaming the rooms and hallways of a really small mansion.  It's not action-based or interesting in any way other than the ironic and comedic portions that involve aliens and their many hilarious one liners.  There's strategy in making your way through the house but it's kind of tacky due to the game being so short and feeling incomplete.  There's no action whatsoever so the replay value is nonexistent which is another major issue with the game. Maniac Mansion feels like it's caught between Home Alone and A Boy and His Blob except it lacks the suspense of Home Alone and the clever puzzle solving and adventure of A Bob and His Blob.  I'm not sure whether Maniac Mansion is based off a movie or not because the music is memorable enough to reach a level higher than video games.  It's fully developed and well-written enough to be comparable to a TV show theme.  That's what makes me suspicious that the game may be a video game version of a movie or show (or perhaps cartoon).  Each selectable character has their own theme song, and with the orange-haired guy the music is exceptionally memorable because it's some kind of groovy upbeat, danceable tune multi-part song that sounds like mid 80's Frank Zappa.  The orange-haired lady has a theme that reminds me of the late 70's/early 80's rock band the Cars.  Really awesome and catchy music at least. Though the story doesn't make a bit of sense and the game is based entirely on solving clues Scooby Doo style, at least the occasional dialogue provides a few short laughs.  Otherwise a really forgettable and highly overrated video game that you'll never play again unless it's 20 years later and you're looking to take a trip down memory lane.</td><td>unpleasant mansion on the hill</td><td>1407888000</td><td>0</td><td>322</td><td>1470</td><td>15</td><td>4.565217391304348</td><td>21.466666666666665</td><td>0.032090276</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>14312</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>12 4, 2012</td><td>B00004SVS5</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Mega Man 3 is, from a challenge point of view, a step up from MM2.  An obvious step up in fact.  Enemies and obstacles are twice as aggressive.  Maybe it's just me but I feel the music isn't nearly as good as the first two MM games.  In fact MM4 and 5 have significantly more interesting theme music as well. Again, just like my experience with the other MM games in the series that aren't MM2, Mega Man 3 will be remembered for being yet *another* game in the series that had a challenge too overwhelming for me a youngster.  I believe I completed one stage and that's it.  This would have been back in the early 90's.  It's a shame I felt the game was too hard back then and gave up.  Nowadays I can approach any kind of challenge with open arms and play it despite how many times I'll probably lose. What makes this game so hard are the boss fights, and a few of the stages as well (such as the first portion of Gemini Man's stage- I can't tell you HOW many times those fireballs knocked me into a nearby bottomless pit, ugh!).  These boss fights are much MUCH faster and target Mega Man more precisely than the boss fights in the rest of the MM games.  This means you better be prepared to walk into the battle well-equipped!  If not, well, kiss your robotic buns goodnight, haha.  The trade off is that the part where you have to re-fight the 8 bosses before the final Wily confrontation can be finished in several seconds if you go into the battles completely certain which weapon is weak against said boss. Rush the dog is awesome.  He can boost Mega Man to higher areas or glide Mega Man across the screen away from all danger below.  He's very convenient for a game like this.  I also notice in one stage with bubbles that it was probably an influence for Bubble Crab's stage from Mega Man X2.  Overall, great game with a big challenge- it takes skill and a whole lot of patience to master these older Mega Man games.  Actually it takes skill and patience just to figure out the proper order of the stages/bosses, which helps ease the challenge a bit.

Each robot has their own stage that you must pass through before actually getting to fight one of them. Once you defeat a robot master, you take his power, and then use it if necessary. Unfortunately, the game is really hard. Thank god there are passwords. What made this game stand out is how the robot masters from MegaMan 2 (Crash Man, Flash Man, etc) come back for an encore.

The weakest one of the NES bunch, however, is Mega Man 5. Now, don't get me wrong. Mega Man 5 is still a very great game. But compared to all the other Mega Mans on the same console, this one just wasn't worth it for most fans. I lost hope when I heard that this just wasn't good enough. Fortunately for me, I loved it as much as the rest. While the music doesn't sound too lively, the series' signature graphics and basic gameplay still shine through greatly. Unfortunately, the gameplay has been hampered by the fact that most of the bosses' powers are terrible. The Power Stone misses everything, the Charge Kick rarely does anything, Star Man's stars are worthless in most cases, and the list would go on. Whatever you do, just stick with your regular power. Even Rush isn't so great here. Although you do have to face those flaws, that still doesn't mean the overall game is bad. The level design is still just as creative as in the other games, and there's still a good challenge in the game. Speaking of challenge, that is kinda lowered down, too. You get a bigger chance of getting extra lives and health restorers. That way, both newbies and long-time Mega Man fans can enjoy the game. I also like how you have to collect M-E-G-A-M-A-N-V letters for a little something extra. It reminds me of how you must collect Chaos Emeralds in the Sonic games for secret endings. All the flaws that I mentioned may be major to some fans, but for me, those are minor complaints. Simply put: Mega Man 5 is still an awesome game.</td><td>Don't lose hope!

MM5 has plenty of really cool features and mainly focuses on an outer space-type level design.  This is one thing that caught my attention immediately back in the day. I remember 20 years ago when my mom would rent this game for me.  I did poorly back then.  I was able to complete exactly ONE stage, and now I can't even remember which stage it was!  Ah, a trip down memory lane when video games meant the absolute world to me.  Back then I considered Mega Man games *enormously* difficult.  This was a couple years before the X series came out.  I was totally confused and needed help to figure out which stages/bosses I was supposed to battle first.  For some reason I had trouble figuring this out and didn't have a Nintendo Power in my possession to help me.  Even though I was subscribing back then, I never had the issues that would help me through these Mega Man games.  The good news is that the challenge seems more understandable and less intimidating as an adult, however. Anyway, yeah, these levels are really colorful for an NES game.  A graphical and background-filled upgrade in comparison to MM4, but probably only a slight one.  One stage even has the jet ski!  Talk about cool.  I didn't think the NES had the ability to use it without the play control slowing down significantly due to the speed and the amount of enemies going by the screen, but I was wrong- it flows near flawlessly.  One thing's for absolute sure- you HAVE to have the correct weapon in your inventory when entering a boss fight.  Having the right weapon hasn't been this important since the very first Mega Man game (and it was VERY important in that game).  Also make sure you don't accidentally enter the fight without enough weapon energy or you'll pay in the worst way! The music is really good this time around, but probably not quite as memorable as the themes from MM4.  Even though as an adult I find the challenge level more bearable, it doesn't change the fact that the game is still rock hard.  You *will* lose plenty of lives so be prepared for that, and there is a degree of practice required in pushing your way through these stages successfully by experimenting with the right weapons and avoiding all the dangerous traps (of which there's many).  This is what the X games lack, however.  In the MMX games it doesn't really matter how you get through the stages because you'll probably survive no matter what due to the generosity of health energy scattered everywhere and enemies normally being less threatening.  Not so here.  I like MM5 though, because it reminds me of a good old-fashioned arcade experience.  Raw, relentless and sometimes aggravating.  That's what makes the older MM games so splendid.</td><td>pretty hard game, I believe</td><td>1163116800</td><td>0</td><td>525</td><td>2299</td><td>28</td><td>4.379047619047619</td><td>18.75</td><td>0.113673024</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>14420</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>08 21, 2011</td><td>B00004SVSH</td><td>Ryan Sil.

It came to Nintendo's virtual console, so I decided why not download it for a change?  After all, in the late 80's early 90's I really enjoyed this game.  It was really something to have.  Years later it's apparent of two things: The game was horribly designed, and it CAN'T stand the test of time.  The fact that on Nintendo's VC it's also a dollar more than the other NES games is also questioning.  It's hard to make a game this bad. If you were a fan of the Turtles a long time ago back in the early 90's the first thing you'll notice about the game is that it hardly has anything to do with the show at all outside of some of the major characters.  Outside of that there are no foot soldiers, and most of the enemies you encounter you never saw in the show in the first place.  You will come across Bebop and Rocksteady but none of the other enemies were actually ever in the show in the first place.  Kind of daunting. What really makes the game horrible, however, lies within the gameplay.  Firstly, the turtles themselves are unbalanced and put to unfair use.  You can switch between any of the turtles at a time, but for the most part, only one of them is of any use to getting you through the adventure.  Michaelangelo and Raphael are completely useless, as their weapons lack to the range to actually do anything.  Leonardo is alright, but Donatello is the only real useful one here, as he's the only one who can attack downward and at a range.  More than likely you'll only want to use the other three to sacrifice so that Donatello can do some beating up on enemies. The way the levels are designed is also horrendous.  You basically walk around an overworld map and go into sewers, warehouses and whatnot.  The problem is that you never know where to go next.  This non-linear style wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many blasted dead ends.  To make the experience even more grueling, the game is just FULL of enemies that will respawn almost the second you turn around.  You could go through a tough warehouse fighting tons of tough enemies, only to find you can't go any further.  So now you'll have to backtrack and you may have to fight all those enemies again.  So if you don't lose a turtle getting to a dead end, you'll probably lose him getting from it. The game isn't really difficult, it's just unfair and frustrating.  The fact that two of your four players are completely useless tells you something.  The later turtles games were far better than this.  Skip the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game.  It's so unfair that the experience is frustrating.  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II and III were far better, and there's still no turtles game that beats the all time best: Turtles IV: Turtles in Time.  If you need a classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fix, the first Turtles game on the NES isn't going to do it.</td><td>A Horribly Designed Game</td><td>1176422400</td><td>1</td><td>556</td><td>2343</td><td>32</td><td>4.2140287769784175</td><td>17.375</td><td>-0.056035053</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>14440</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>11 19, 2010</td><td>B00004SVV8</td><td>Ryan Sil.

I'm totally shocked since I like the first one on the NES.  Snake's Revenge just does so many things wrong I don't know where to begin in describing the many noticeable problems.  Let's start with the way Snake moves.  He moves slow and clunky this time around as do the enemies, whereas on the first Metal Gear the pace moves swiftly.  Nothing particularly great mind you, but a lot better than this. Stealth and infiltrating is comically an afterthought now.  Yes that's right- you know how you're supposed to avoid being detected by guards?  Know how you're supposed to walk up behind them or sneak around without being noticed?  Well Snake's Revenge seems to abandoned this great concept unintentionally with horrible gameplay and slow, uninspiring animations of the tiny characters and foes we see on screen.  You can practically walk directly up to a guard and be mere inches in front of him without him freaking out and spotting you.  What in the world?  However the funniest thing about this game is that the animations are so pitiful when you punch or shoot someone to death, they show no reaction to the fact you just damaged them so they freeze in place, then a moment later they simply disappear.  LOL!  The first Metal Gear was a lot better than this. Most of the gameplay involves walking throughout abandoned and very generically created storage facilities with a strong emphasis on finding items (such as the overuse of collecting and using key cards) in small rooms to advance the... not the plot since the game practically has none, but to advance to the next boring part of the storage facility while equally unimpressive music appears throughout your little quest.  I actually think the horrible animation of the guards along with your character and overall taking a few steps back compared to the first Metal Gear is the biggest issue I have with this game.  The lack of enemy variety is another problem, as is the repetition of looking for items, rescuing trapped people that give simple useless advice with laughably bad grammar, and of course the unbearably slow play control are MORE major issues.  This game is a disaster all around. The challenge level goes up a lot just as soon as you find yourself in rooms with floor traps such as disappearing floor tiles that expand really wide and other types of traps that require carefully maneuvering around in order to succeed.  This is all rather difficult.  The game has a way of making the boss fights really difficult and swarming you from many different directions but countering this with simplistic guards roaming the hallways in the other portions of the game, so Snake's Revenge has major imbalance issues.  In fact most of your time is spent walking back through the tiny rooms where you came and loading up on ammo since ammo reappears in the same spot the moment you leave the room.  You can easily fill up on ammo this way.  Not that you really need much of it except for the inevitable boss fights.  The story is nonexistent and unexceptional, and I can't think of a single reason to ever play this train wreck of a game.  It's just awful no matter how you slice it.</td><td>snake's lost it</td><td>1408233600</td><td>0</td><td>580</td><td>2624</td><td>27</td><td>4.524137931034483</td><td>21.48148148148148</td><td>-0.062098023</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>14517</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>07 25, 2014</td><td>B00004SVYE</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Well I'm a bit surprised!  I remember Zelda II: The Adventure of Link as a youngster in the late 80's as a very mediocre Zelda title and almost like the type of game that would be considered a quick cash in, in today's world (which makes me think that's what Hyrule Warriors is going to be before the next real Zelda Wii U title game comes out for example, but that's another subject). Anyway Zelda II does have its share of tiny issues that somewhat hamper the experience.  For one thing it bothers me that Link has a short sword the entire game, meaning you have to come within close range to damage some VERY dangerous enemies making the process of learning their attack patterns/movements absolutely mandatory in order to succeed.  I'd much rather have a longer sword and I imagine everyone else feels the same way. Let's see, I used to hate the fact that, in full RPG style, while roaming the overworld enemies would often come out of nowhere and you'd be placed in a side scroller type environment and have to battle them.  However I totally didn't realize as a kid that this game uses a level up experience system, which means the more enemies you finish off the stronger you'll be for the later harder dungeons.  You don't collect fairies in a bottle so you have to rely on this experience point system to provide health and magic when you need it.  Understanding the way the point system works has allowed me to change my mind about kicking up enemies accidentally in the overworld and having to face them.  I look forward to the random enemy encounters.  It keeps the game somewhat unpredictable as well which is a positive. Speaking of the side scroller view, well by now when it comes to 2D Zelda I think practically *all* of us prefer the top/down view since the original Legend of Zelda set the standards for 2D Zelda much like Ocarina of Time set the standards for 3D Zelda, but I don't think seeing Link in side scroller view is that bad at all.  To be honest it only looks awkward since I'm used to top/down or 3D. Another complaint is that the enemies do get repetitive despite the game being short with only 6 dungeons and taking less than 3-4 hours to complete (though your first few times through the game will take MANY hours due to the difficulty).  Perhaps because of the design, the dungeons aren't as interesting as they could've been and they often lack the kind of atmosphere that usually makes dungeons such a treat in most Zelda games.  However the good news (at least to me) is that the enemies are often very dangerous to the point that all it takes is for Link to be in the wrong spot and the wrong time and you'll eat up all of your health. Now a lot of people think it's an unfair challenge to progress steadily for several minutes only to make one wrong move and you'll be dead, however I think such a challenge is welcoming since it means mastering and treading carefully through each and every room and gradually learning the best way to deal with danger if you're willing to give the game a legitimate chance.  Basically since the dungeons don't feel threatening due to lack of atmosphere and poor dated very uncastle-like design, at least the hard enemies make them fun.  One dungeon in particular, I think it's the fifth one, is VERY long and swarming with danger.  At least the game provides 1-ups but truthfully they're not enough to make the quest feel any easier. You'll probably need every single one of them. This is one tough game folks! Somewhat surprised the boss battles are usually pretty awesome and fairly clever for their age.  More surprised that instead of collecting the heart piece afterwards, you have to search for them (usually in the overworld).  You can only have 8 bars of health and with no fairies in a bottle to replenish your life... yeah, this is hard!  The overworld could stand to be more interesting graphically (the only graphics complaint I have with the game mind you) but at least it features all the familiar areas we've come to expect from Zelda such as water, mountains, grasslands and graveyards.  It's decent, and in fact the entire game is decent.  Perhaps the towns are a letdown since they're really tiny (only a couple screens long) and the townspeople say the shortest most generic things ever in less than 6 words usually.  You can however enter a few homes for important keys at certain times. It's a pretty short game, it's by no means anywhere in the same category as the first Zelda but gosh darn it- I enjoy Zelda II: The Adventure of Link despite all the flaws.

The experimental RPG exploration that made up the entirety of Simon's Quest have been removed, and good riddance says most of CV fans, I imagine.  Back in full force is the traditional way of moving through levels, whipping candles and enemies, fighting a boss at the end, and rinse and repeat until you complete the game.  Basically, the level design that we've come to admire from the first Castlevania returns with a few new interesting features.  One is the ability to switch between 3 different characters.  Each one makes whatever dilemma you happen to face more bearable/beatable since they have their own unique abilities.  Trevor is like Simon from the original Castlevania, Grant can walk on the ceiling which is somewhat Exorcist-like and freaky but also very dependable more often than not, Sypha reminds me of a magical glowing spirit of some kind and Alucard unfortunately isn't nearly as cool as his Symphony of the Night version but he does possess the ability to turn into a bat which enables easily getting through some of the trickier platform areas. The music is catchier this time around as well.  More energetic, rocking and faster paced themes that better suit the frantic gameplay of surviving.  The challenge is bigger than ever (disappearing bridge anyone?  Haha).  Medusa heads contribute to the difficulty more than anything else thanks to the way they move up and down in the air while coming towards you.  Hey they made the original Castlevania extremely difficult as well so no surprise there!  It's really hard avoiding them.  Even harder than in Castlevania: Symphony of the Night but probably not as hard as in SCIV where they *really* make you want to rip your hair out thanks to that one rotating room.  Ugh!  This game allows you to take different paths, but for the most part this game is a straight forward experience. The only thing preventing this game from being 5 stars is perhaps the fact that Super Castlevania IV takes the same formula and makes it slightly better (and arguably more challenging, despite all the claims that SCIV is the easiest game in the series... I beg to differ!)  I just feel Super Castlevania IV is more challenging, has better gameplay, richer backgrounds and music that's simply more awesome (due to being orchestrated).  However, this is a must own game too.  Think of it as Super Castlevania IV's baby brother.  However despite being slightly easier, Castlevania III has one VERY hard boss fight at the very end.  I'm referring to his final form in round 3.  If there's a technique or pattern to avoid the lightning strikes while walking on moving platforms I can't find it because getting through this battle seems kind of miraculous to me.  Tough as nails! I believe this is clearly the best Castlevania game on the NES.  It's also the biggest and most exciting.  Let's face it, the original Castlevania is WAY too hard, and Castlevania II is a misstep due to the repetitive and poorly used questionable RPG elements with lousy enemy variety.  Castlevania III however gets the formula exactly right and is a major improvement on all levels, making it the perfect CV game for your NES collection.  Wait, you DO still want to build an NES collection right?  You should!  The games are simply awesome.</td><td>whippin' up a frenzy</td><td>1354233600</td><td>1</td><td>586</td><td>2708</td><td>28</td><td>4.621160409556314</td><td>20.928571428571427</td><td>0.1665236</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>14597</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>08 31, 2013</td><td>B00004SVXV</td><td>Ryan Sil.

The control has you restricted to short jumps, punches, and kicks. The whole point of Kung Fu is to use your basic movement wisely. Sure, you can bash some punks easily by punching repeatedly, but then you'll later have to encounter guys that throw knives, orbs that dragons would evolve from, and winged insects that would fly high or below. As brief as it is (Only 5 levels?!), Kung Fu is one heck of a gem.

This is one bad son of a gun.  Sure, you think he's adorable and you want to cuddle him.  But be warned: many people think the same way about koala bears.  And what happens when you try picking one of those up?  That's right.  And the same thing might happen to you with Kirby. Kirby is one dangerous boy/man/puffball/lady whatever.  You should know just by looking at him that he's capable of something angry.  Oh sure, he's cute and cuddly on the outside but on the inside it's a whole other story.  He's a vicious creature.  You think you know him... you don't.  What would possess Nintendo to create such a monster?  Maybe revenge, for players everywhere getting angry whenever they lose a life playing one of their games (such as the hardest setting of Star Fox or the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2) and therefore throwing their controller in anger and breaking it.  But then Nintendo would be making money that way when players return to buy another controller, so Kirby's creation must be some kind of secret Nintendo undercover behind closed doors genius operation. Think about it. Kirby was meant to fade away with time.  His popularity was meant to hang around for a couple years, and then when the NES went out and the Super NES came in, Kirby should have disappeared.  But he didn't.  He continued to appear in new adventures with Nintendo's new video game systems and he became a survivor, and he's still going strong 15 years later.  It wasn't supposed to happen.  How could it happen?  Nintendo is about ready to release another video game system.  I think next year.  Will Kirby make an appearance on that system?  I think he will.  It gives me chills to think about the things Kirby is capable of.  He won't go away.  This wasn't meant to happen.  Nintendo created a monster and now it's out of control. So as you see Kirby is not such a friendly puffball.  It's all a disguise.  Nintendo knows it, and you should know it too.  Damn you Nintendo! As for this game, it's a lot of fun.  It's Kirby before he turned into a monster children the world over became frightened by.  Do not make the mistake of thinking he's innocent.  Buy this game anyway, and remember a time when Kirby was friendly and lovable and gave video game players a pleasant after taste.  He's Kirby, he packs a mean punch, and I do mean mean. This isn't a very expensive game so you should buy it.  No one thought it would happen, but Kirby lives on.  Pick up this adventure to return to an innocent time. Now for some other thoughts.  This game is somewhat unusual in that it doesn't feel like a platform game and feels more like a party game of sorts.  This is because Kirby has so many moves in his arsenal and so many techniques required to advance to the next part of the game that each and every level feels remarkably different.  No I mean, not just different in design (you have forest, castle and ship levels) but Kirby HIMSELF is different.  He does different things each level.  This is nothing like Mario who normally spends his time jumping on goombas and koopa shells every game, or Donkey Kong who throws barrels and collect bananas, or Samus who shoots space pirates and collects data.  Kirby's different in that he can suck in enemies and use them as projectiles to spit them out at enemies as an attack method which was an original idea back in the early 90's.  He can breathe fire, ice, float around, turn into a tire, turn into spikes, turn into a laser beam shooting spaceship, use invincibility, swing a sword and so many other things.  The variety is different for every level. The enemy variety is insane too.  You have spikey jellyfish creatures, monkeys walking on balls like they're part of a circus act, deformed and oddly designed regular animals such as rabbits, frogs, bees, porcupines and rabbit-shaped pink birds.  Seriously, what ARE these creatures?  At least they're highly original whatever they are.  You also have cannons and cannonballs, mushroom-shaped foes, shy guy-like foes riding down on parachutes, spinning cylinder stationary things, and armored sword swinging bad guys.  An INSANE amount of variety! The boss fights are pretty good, but I'm totally surprised the very last boss fight consists of three VERY different missions, each one providing just as much intensity as the others.  The second battle in particular in outer space blasting stars at a floating planet is the most memorable one for me.  The levels themselves are pretty basic but the game is surprisingly HUGE for an NES game, featuring over 20 levels!  Wow!  This game takes a couple hours to complete even if you're doing particularly well (and this game offers a pretty high challenge so you won't be blowing through it as easily as say, a Super Mario Bros. or Metroid game).  The music ranges from mediocre and annoying to REALLY good in a couple spots (such as the Grape Garden stage- I LOVE that sad little memorable piece of music!) Another aspect of the levels is that you need to find and jump on top of these big switches which opens up new areas of the game.  Pretty cool concept.  Also some of the mini games are weird such as standing in a boxing ring and ducking to avoid the bombs to rack up points, having a wild west showdown, and the one where you have to grab Kirby items with a hook inside a toy machine (I can't remember what these actual machines are called- there's an exact name for them).  These aren't particularly fun games but nice additions I suppose. Overall, great game.  Sometimes the cuteness factor rubs me the wrong way and the platforming aspect seems to take a backseat so Kirby's huge variety of moves can take center stage which isn't always a good thing because sometimes the game feels like it offers *too* much and loses its compactness as a result.  But hey, Earthworm Jim is guilty of the same excessive variety type of level design and I love that series.  Pick up Kirby's Adventure and watch out for that puffball.</td><td>cute killing action</td><td>1132358400</td><td>1</td><td>1119</td><td>4899</td><td>67</td><td>4.378016085790884</td><td>16.70149253731343</td><td>0.0055137947</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>14665</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>11 30, 2012</td><td>B00004SVS4</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Mega Man 4 might go down as one of the hardest Mega Man games I've EVER played.  Don't get me wrong, there's several difficult moment in X5 and X6, and Mega Man 5 isn't exactly a walk through the colorful cherry orchard park either, but overall MM4 might take the cake for the most consistently difficult Mega Man game I've ever put inside one of my video game consoles.  I remember my mother renting this game for me at the video game store uptown back in 1990-1991, and of course, I was the foolish one who picked it out assuming it'd be loads of fun and... well yeah, the game *is* loads of fun, but the constant relentless assault from the many enemies you encounter in nearly every single stage is nearly enough to make me wish I hadn't asked for this game so many times during my childhood. The music is REALLY good though.  Who knows, the music itself may be the biggest reason I used to rent this game so many times back then.  Skull Man in particular has a theme that's really melodic.  On the negative, the first Wily stage has terrible music.  This game moreso than all the other Mega Man games reminds me of that robot movie from the mid 80's called Short Circuit.  That movie used to excite me like no other.  The levels are all packed with several obstacles.  You have spikes which we've pretty much grown accustomed to in the Mega Man series by this point, moving block platforms that can be an absolutely *nightmare* if you don't handle your jumping patterns correctly (and when I was a kid- surprise surprise, missing and falling these particular platforms is how I ended up losing the most lives). At least Mega Man has a sliding move that's really effective when the situation ever gets TOO intense.  Quite often you can simply slide beyond the danger and make it to a temporary safe area.  Thank goodness for this feature!  Where the difficulty REALLY increases in during the Wily stages.  Trust me, you don't even want to know how hard some of these stages are.  The one stage with spikes on the block platforms that actually *rotate* to a different spot... MY goodness!!  You're in for more than a rude awakening, that's for sure!  This is the one Mega Man game I'm always reluctant to play due to the high challenge it brings time and time again.  It does get easier with practice, but let's be honest here- if you wake up on the wrong side of the bed and experience an off day, your timing will be off too.  You cannot have one of those days and expect to blow through a game like this without any trouble.  You've been warned. The boss fights are hard too mainly because if you happen to come unprepared such as say, your weapon meter is nearly empty when you arrive to the fight or you simply don't have the right weapon in your possession, the bosses will make you pay for that, and the regular arm cannon might not be good enough to get the job done either.  Another benefit is that Rush the dog makes an appearance and he helps with some of the harder to reach areas by climbing on top of him and sailing across (or up) the screen. Overall, Mega Man's fourth adventure offers a significantly increased challenge in comparison to the previous three, so please PLEASE keep this in mind if you so much as dare to play this game.</td><td>it's all mega</td><td>1354233600</td><td>0</td><td>617</td><td>2636</td><td>29</td><td>4.27228525121556</td><td>21.275862068965516</td><td>0.01935217</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>14676</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>06 12, 2012</td><td>B00004SVR9</td><td>Ryan Sil.

Not only did you run and jump like in other platformers, but you can eat enemies, and spit them out at others! Oh, and you can fly! All of that was pretty exciting to experience in Kirby's debut title. However, Kirby's second game, Kirby's Adventure, is a lot like that in several ways......only SUPERSIZED!!! Kirby's Dream Land was composed of only 4 levels (Not counting King Dedede's castle). Here, there are 7 WORLDS, with a set of levels in EACH ONE! This makes Dream Land look like a demo in comparison. To top off the seemingly huge length, there's a save feature. So what else should you expect from this already great game? Well, this is the first Kirby game in which you can STEAL ENEMIES' POWERS AND USE THEM YOURSELF!!! Note that there weren't a lot of games back then (Or maybe even now) that allowed you to do such a cool thing. See that bad guy with a sword? Holy crap! I can use that sword!

While the game itself is totally addicting and fun, and contains two game modes (One with and without blocks already added onscreen), it pales in comparison to pretty much every other version of Tetris in existence. Even the Game Boy version contains an extra 2-Player versus mode, which this version strangely lacks.

Like Tetris, Yoshi has a single-player mode and a 2-Player versus mode. Both make for incredibly addicting experiences! You can stack up 2 of the signature Mario enemies of the same type (Goomba, Boo, Piranha Plant, and Blooper) to make them disappear, OR for a much more amusing situation, you could stack up the enemies atop the bottom half of an egg, and place the upper half on top of it all. Suddenly, BOOM, the enemies have been CRAMMED into an egg! As for the versus mode, you know what to expect when it comes to a puzzle game containing this feature. Make as much enemy sandwiches as possible, causing the other player to be given a certain obstacle, and so on. So, if you have a puzzle itch to scratch, Yoshi is right up your alley.

It became a cultural phenomenon. Usually when a game achieves an unusual amount of success you'll have a game try to copy the formula (usually failing).  Doctor Mario, on the other hand, didn't try to copy the formula put forth in Tetris.  It simply put a new spin on the puzzle genre. Dr. Mario perhaps some of the simplest gameplay of any game.  Mario stands on the sidelines and throws pills into a jar.  In the jar are different color viruses.  Red, Yellow and Blue.  The color of the virus doesn't matter.  What matters is the colors on the pill Mario throws in.  The objective is to simply match the corresponding color of the pill with the virus.  In the first level, there are just a few viruses.  The higher the level the more viruses are in the jar. You don't have to begin at level one.  You can choose what level you want to begin with.  Even then, the game doesn't end at the maximum level you can choose.  It keeps going.  Much like Tetris, there's really no end to the game. You can also choose your speed.  Medium, Low, or High.  This is really the only thing which will add difficulty to the game.  Mario not only throws pills faster, but they fall faster, depending on the speed you choose. It doesn't sound like much, but the game is addictive.  Especially when playing against someone else.  It's not as addictive as Tetris and competition becomes more based on how fast you can do certain levels rather than actual skill.  But then again, there's not much skill involved in Dr. Mario.  Which is exactly why Dr. Mario works.  The game is so simple that anyone can play it. Visually for an NES game it looks pretty basic.  Very colorful.  Although Mario has never looked better, there isn't much you can say about Dr. Mario's graphics because they're just so basic.  Even for an NES game.  So there's nothing groundbreaking even for its time.  But who cares?  The game is fun and in the NES days that was what you played for.  It's a great game and its simple.  While there's no doubt that Tetris had nothing to fear, Dr. Mario was still a fun game. If there was anything wrong with Dr. Mario it would simply be that there's no real way to build upon it.  All the future releases of the game have pretty much been the same thing over and over again, just on a different console.  This isn't necessarily bad, but it means that if you own one of the other variants, say the Gameboy, Super Nintendo (which is the best one because you get Tetris with it), or Nintendo 64, then you're all set.

This game is really bizarre.  I'm not a fan of the concept but it does blend RPG elements with side scrolling in a way that's not completely awful.  With better execution it probably could have been a great game.  You can choice between 6 characters called camp counselors (because the story is that these counselors have been selected to look after Crystal Lake for the summer not knowing Jason's out there).  3 boys and 3 girls, each containing their own abilities.  Some characters can run fast while others are slow with terrible jumping.  They can all do the basics at least which is run, jump, use weapons and row canoes.  Right away this seems like the game is trying to be more complex than necessary. The object is to walk to different areas of the lake preventing Jason from harming children (15 in total) and you also have to keep the 6 playable (counselor) characters alive as well in your quest to keep the children safe. You have to kill Jason at least 3 times, but perhaps the game is random and more deaths are required.  Not sure.  Gather weapons to face Jason, strategize by finding health potions, keys to unlock hidden cabins in the woods or lake and distribute weapons among the counselors so everyone remains alive and well.  Nice strategy. The difficulty is high due to the confusion of figuring out where to go and Jason popping up and causing problems (he gets faster and harder later on).  It's hard to figure out where to go because the game wasn't worked on long enough to differentiate one area from another, so many places look exactly the same.  Probably my biggest problem with the game (though to be fair you are given a map even if it's confusing, inaccurate and sends you heading the wrong way).  The map is useful in determining where Jason is however- a green dot on the map will indicate which cabin he's in so head over there as fast as you can or he'll kill a counselor.  I don't like the limited moves during the cabin fights with Jason- you can only move side to side or duck.  Well besides using a weapon too. Your weapons include rocks, knives, machetes and torches.  You have to be close to enemies when throwing rocks to land your shot because the aim is in an arch direction which means a lot of times you'll miss.  Near the beginning you come across a lighter need to light fireplaces and a knife.  Whenever you hear a beep it means Jason found a counselor or kid, and you only have a limited amount of time to find the cabin containing Jason.  If you don't find the cabin in time he'll kill a counselor, but if you DO find the cabin in time a kid will say \"Thank You\".  Speaking of cabins you often have to enter them for a variety of reasons.  This is where the strategy comes into play.  Inside these cabins you can battle Jason for one thing, or help your counselors perform actions such as cure an injured character, switch between counselors, give a weapon to someone in need or pick up notes. The way you search the lake/forest area is by finding paths north and south that you'll often see as you walk across the screen.  This is really clunky and awful level design in my opinion because, again, the paths all look very similar, and every path you take is dominated with the same few enemies (mostly zombies) that it turns into a bundle of confusion after a while.  To be fair the backgrounds offer nice variety using different colors to accurately show different times of the day.  This sort of helps differentiate one area from another.  The scenery approaching nightfall is the most interesting, but it's only temporary since the game uses a day/night cycle.  The caves and forests look okay but I've seen my share of those over the years.  Plus they can be confusing too.  While I normally never base a game on graphics, the way you take these many paths and end up on different screens is particularly clunky and low budget looking.  An NES game though, I get it. Jason isn't the only boss fight either- there's also a purple haired demonic head that appears sometimes.  I should mention that the boss fights aren't like the ones you'd find in most 2D games- these ones are positioned near the top of the screen as the camera changes into a first person view which is probably supposed to capture the tension-filled feeling of the bosses being in front of you (I don't feel the tension though).  I don't mind the different view but the boss fights themselves are *really* mediocre.  With only Jason and a demonic head, the game feels incomplete. Also, LOL!  For a while I had no idea the purple monster coming after me was Jason.  I thought it was just some purple monster.  Running from Jason (or Jason running from you, heh) are a numerous and redundant occurrence throughout this game.  Wherever you go you're treated to more zombies (geez haven't seen enough of those!)  Other enemies include wolves and diving black birds (all poorly animated).  That's about it.  Really bland small selection.  Also you come across Jason WAY too many times for such a short game.  This is clearly because the game doesn't offer enough variety in levels and enemies, so they throw several Jason appearances your way to make up for it. Not that it matters much, but the game doesn't follow the movies at all.  I understand for the sake of a video game stories are often changed, but I think more suspense could have been implemented such as say, changing the concept so you're constantly running or hiding from Jason.  However maybe that would have backfired in a big way if Home Alone is any indication (one of the worst games ever).  Then again Home Alone would have been a lot better if there had been more ways to take out the robbers, and the home itself was bigger.  The same problem here too- Friday the 13th just needed to be a bigger game. I think my biggest gripe is that Friday the 13th just isn't long enough.  It's just not enough on all counts- not enough enemy variety, not enough stage variety (really feels like I'm going through the same 3 or 4 areas the whole time), a sophisticated concept revolving around fighting Jason that was okay but could have been made better with more places to explore and more dangerous predicaments, Jason not being intimidating whatsoever (unless you count how fast he gets near the end which of course increases the cheapshots because your character can't move nearly as fast as he can), etc.  It honestly doesn't make sense that Jason wouldn't feel like a threat considering he pops up unpredictably a lot of times, but he's just so laughable sporting purple that it's hard to take him seriously.  Well until he gets faster with better weapons near the end- THEN I take him more seriously! Others might see the underrated appeal in the game and the sophistication behind the concept, but it could have been done a whole lot better had the game simply been bigger.  A lack of a map in the woods and caves is just bizarre and only contributes to the confusion.  The lack of a scary atmosphere is favor of more straight forward music is another strange feature of the game.  It really feels like the concept behind Friday the 13th was worked on very well until a certain point, then the game was released incomplete.  The game feels 60% done.  Perhaps the release was following a strict deadline who knows.</td><td>another bad game based on a movie</td><td>1471478400</td><td>1</td><td>1378</td><td>6026</td><td>63</td><td>4.373004354136429</td><td>21.873015873015873</td><td>0.028426541</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>14857</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>07 1, 2015</td><td>B00004SVQU</td><td>Bryan</td><td>I'll give Jackal a high rating, but barely.  I'm tempted to give it an average 3-star rating but I'll refrain.  This is because the game is lacking in a couple key areas.  I mean it only has 6 levels, and rather awkwardly 4 of them are based on military bases while the other 2 are based on green and red swampy areas.  Then again maybe the red area is actually blood? Anyway the game focuses on a top-down view of your green playable jeep.  You drive this jeep around square areas destroying buildings and rescuing or dropping off POW (Prisoner of War) soldiers, avoiding army tank or helicopter enemy fire, and taking on bosses all the while exploring around.  The music is really upbeat and adrenaline-pumping.  It's really catchy like a good NES game is supposed to be.  The boss fights range from easy to hard, and in fact besides the last level which is pretty insane with the amount of enemy fire shooting from many different directions, the boss battles overall are consistent in that they start off easy and gradually get harder.  I admire a game that builds slowly and fairly in challenge.  The game overall is really difficult because every time you take a hit you basically lose a life.  But then again after a while you'll probably be able to master the technique of avoiding enemy danger so this won't even be an issue after a while until you reach the final stage. Overall Jackal is a fantastic game.  it's just on the short side.  6 levels makes the game feel incomplete like it needed more, and it's not just the small amount of stages that makes the game feel incomplete either.  It's also that it feels like there should be more to do.  There should be wider/bigger places to roam, more ways to return fire besides the same selection of missiles and guns, perhaps more vehicles besides just a jeep, etc.  That's the impression I get at least.  However I'm not complaining.  For what it is, a short action-packed game, it works really well.</td><td>jackal</td><td>1435708800</td><td>0</td><td>367</td><td>1590</td><td>21</td><td>4.332425068119891</td><td>17.476190476190474</td><td>-0.022366071</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>14876</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>03 2, 2011</td><td>B00004SVTL</td><td>Ryan Sil.

Okay, so there's nothing TOO new to the Pole Position formula, but Rad Racer is just as fun nonetheless. It kinda has the same basic gameplay as Namco's arcade racer, but that's not really a complaint, since the gameplay is already very good. You can speed up by holding Up. However, that can cause a problem when it comes to turning, so you might want to pull the brakes when a turn comes. The music is well-composed, and the graphics are great for its time.

The game unfortunately feels lacking in several areas compared to MM2, 3, 4 and 5.  The backgrounds are a little boring and repetitive, the gameplay feels slower than what you've come to expect later on and maybe even choppy at times, the amount of enemies are few and far between, and the music is probably not up to par either.  However I believe it's completely forgiveable for a debut to have these problems, especially since it's Mega Man we're talking about here- the action-packed series that satisfied most of our heart-pumping explosion cravings in the 80's and early 90's.  We also need to realize this game was probably a major influence for all the robotic-themed video game series released several years later.  I can't say this with absolute certainty- only knowing this game was highly praised back in the day allows me to assume it was influential to some extent. Yes, you only have 6 bosses and stages compared to what would quickly become the standard (8), but these stages offer a wonderful challenge and gameplay basically the same as Mega Man 2.  To give an example of the games difficulty, these flippable platforms appear early on in one stage that will SURELY force you to lose in controller-slamming fashion until you figure out how they function.  Losing is quite alright though- this game is part of the rough and tough \"expect no mercy\" gaming experience from the mid to late 80's.  This period of gaming is exactly what made the NES so awesome.  It wasn't really about completing the game for many of us- it was about how far we'd be able to progress. This game also uses a points system which seems really odd but again, Capcom didn't know at the time that a point system wasn't really necessary so I can't fault it- only ignore it.  Great start.  Please though, make sure you enter these stages with the correct weapon or you probably won't survive.  Why is this, you wonder?  Because the enemies take away a pretty good amount of damage per hit.  For those who don't like this game, please consider that it could have been a lot worse.</td><td>mega action</td><td>1354579200</td><td>0</td><td>389</td><td>1741</td><td>17</td><td>4.4755784061696655</td><td>22.88235294117647</td><td>0.04130604</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>14904</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>01 29, 2011</td><td>B00004SVXG</td><td>Ryan Sil. (Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>Ah, the MegaMan series. It is probably the hardest Capcom series ever. While the gameplay is unique and solid, and the graphics and sounds are just plain amazing for the NES, the games are also known for their extremely hard difficulty. The first MegaMan is no different (Okay, maybe a little) from that. The title screen is basic, despite the logo, and there are 6 bosses compared to the other games' 8. The screens are more basic looking. However, the main game is what you would expect from a MegaMan game. Having to go through huge levels to get to fight the robot masters at the end of each level, and then you fight Dr. Wily after going through yet another frustrating stage. It's awesome. I don't know what else to say.</td><td>Let's put this in a simple way to review it</td><td>1296259200</td><td>0</td><td>132</td><td>593</td><td>12</td><td>4.492424242424242</td><td>11.0</td><td>0.09332707</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>14911</td><td>3.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>06 16, 2006</td><td>B00004SVXG</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>Of all the games of the NES era, Mega Man sticks out in my mind as being the hardest.  I didn't expect it to include the things that would later go into the series such as the charge shot, or Rush or anything like that, but when I first played it, I was flabbergasted by it's extreme difficulty.  As a kid I thought it was a great game.  Now that I'm older, I can look at it with a critical eye and say that it is a good game, but even for an old school gamer, Mega Man is a game that so rightfully needed the remake that it was garnered in the PSP, and was also a game that seriously needed tweaking even when it was first released in the 80's. As with all old school games of the 8-bit era, Mega Man's focus was not story.  It was gameplay.  Storlyines didn't become important until the 16-bit era.  So if you wanted to know the premise, you needed to read the instruction manual.  Of course, you probably know it without the use of the instruction booklet anyway. Mega Man's gameplay was pretty simple.  You played as the blue bomber and selected one of six robot masters to go off and face.  You went through the level and would eventually find the robot master and take them down.  Each Robot Master was weak to another Robot Masters weapon.  In the end this proved to be a staple of the Mega Man series.  Each time you defeat a boss, you get his weapon and move on.  Fantastic. The game was difficult, though.  And when I say difficult, I'm not joking.  For one, you've got no energy tanks, and the energy pellets that restore health are not dropped very often.  Also, there are no passwords so you have to complete the game in one sitting.  Bosses also did a lot of damage to you.  For a series, Mega Man got off to a great start, but as an indiviual game, the fun is actually taken away because of the difficulty (the Yellow Devil comes to mind).  You're not invulnerabe to spikes if you get hit, and there are no energy tanks.  That makes up the bulk of the difficulty.  This probably won't bother those who played the games in order, but I started with Mega Man II.  The other big thing about the difficulty was the Magnet Beam.  You'll have to grab it in order to get further in Wily's fortress, but you don't get it by traditional means.  You have to find it in a level.  This brings about another gripe with the difficulty, if you go back to a level you must fight that Robot Master AGAIN, and you might not be prepared for that. Music wise I also didn't think highly of the first Mega Man.  A lot of the music just didn't sound fantastic to begin with.  There were some good tunes (Wily's fortress, Cut Man's stage), but there were also tunes I dreaded a lot (Ice Man's stage, the Boss Fight music).  Again, though, this is the first game.  It's just getting things started. Mega Man is a good game, but the extreme difficulty might be a bit much for even your average old school gamer who's used to such difficult feats.  It's a good game, and it'll probably test your skills more than the likes of Contra.  However, I'm not the kind of gamer who is used to that.  I was able to complete Mega Man, but it's not an easy game.  But I've heard of gamers going through the whole game without getting hit once, which means the difficulty really does provide a lot of fun.</td><td>The Start of a Great Series, but with Frustration</td><td>1150416000</td><td>1</td><td>654</td><td>2626</td><td>40</td><td>4.015290519877676</td><td>16.35</td><td>0.06747927</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>14957</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>04 10, 2011</td><td>B00004SVVJ</td><td>Ryan Sil.

Konami has released a highly popular arcade game called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which is based off of the also popular comic and television series of the same name. In the same year, Konami also made a TMNT game for the NES. It was rather a platformer instead of a port of the arcade game. A year later, the arcade game was ported to the NES as TMNT II: The Arcade Game. Now, here's TMNT III, released in 1992. Is it as good as the arcade game? Yes, it is. The graphics are even better, the sounds are great, the music still rocks, and the gameplay is pure beat 'em up goodness. If you loved the arcade game, then you will totally enjoy smashing through ninjas in this game's levels. In face, there are some cool new moves you can perform. You can also just flat-out pick up the enemy with your weapon and throw him behind you! The action is also tighter than in the arcade game. Unfortunately, the life bar isn't as big as the previous game (NES version), but at least you can still plow through the enemies easily. I find myself using the pick-up-enemy-with-weapon move very often. It kills the enemy within 1 hit, while it takes 4 hits to kill with normal attacks. Overall, this is a very fun game. I recommend you to buy this, especially if you and your friend love the Ninja Turtles.</td><td>TMNT dominates again</td><td>1302393600</td><td>0</td><td>244</td><td>1062</td><td>17</td><td>4.352459016393443</td><td>14.352941176470589</td><td>0.02967477</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>14967</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>11 24, 2010</td><td>B00004SVYQ</td><td>Ryan Sil.

However, the NES would soon prove to be the most revolutionary video game system of all time, thanks to a slew of quality first party games that would have overaching legacies, and possibly the best third party support until the release of Sony's original Playstation.  There are so many great games that were made for the NES, and it's simply designed controlers and the Zapper Light Gun prepheril were ahead of their time.  Younger gamers today more used to the unbelievable graphics of the XBox or PS2 will balk at the simplistic 8-bit presentation of the NES, but for the rest of us who owned an NES during our childhood will remember just how revolutionary and amazing it was in it's day.

To save the princess, he basically has to go through hell with all the dangerous monsters he's forced to face along the way. A little guy like him has to stand up to THOUSANDS of monsters along the way. You really have to stay on your toes if you want to stay alive and finish the game. I love how such a simple story can stand up for years and years, and the gameplay never gets old because the game provides a perfect challenge.  All you fancy gamers out there today- you don't NEED a fancy story to have a solid video game.  Here's your example of that- find the princess and go through many different enemies and many difficult obstacles and complete them.  It's that easy... or is it? Swinging that sword and moving Link around is SO easy. I actually use the shield in this game.  How many times do I need a shield in video games?  Not often. I love how, every time I walk into a new screen, it's like walking into a new land, with a new challenge. Every area of the land and every area of the castle feels like it was carefully created and distinct. In every other Zelda game I've played, there were parts that were just boring to walk through and a chore to complete. Nothing like that in this game.  As I mention above: you are required to stay on your toes because of the very large amount of enemies just about everywhere you turn.  If you can't handle that, then don't play this game. It also feels really good when you go through a castle and defeat the boss. Even the very first one. It's amazing how the upbeat atmosphere of completing a castle can be so simple, and yet, so brilliant. Thanks to the heroic music, you really feel like you've just accomplished something big. I've been playing this game for over 15 years and even though I'm an adult now, there's a certain childhood feeling that immediately returns whenever I play this game. Having two quests featured in one game just makes the whole experience feel complete- it makes a great game almost perfect now. It blows my mind that a game from 1986 can be so enormous.  In fact, this game takes a lot longer to complete than most games out there today. I think if someone asked me what my favorite game of all-time would be, I might have to go with the original Zelda. Maybe Medal of Honor (the first one on the Playstation) would be my next choice. If you can't handle a difficult game, then don't bother playing the original Zelda.  You won't be able to handle it.  However, even though I'm not really a good gamer by any stretch of the imagination, I can still complete both quests.  It just takes a lot of time and patience. It makes you wonder what the first person who had to write a guide for this game was doing when he or she first found out there are hidden entrances around the land and inside the dungeons. If I remember right, don't you have to hold down on the directional pad for a few moments as you're facing a wall in order to access the hidden entrance? Imagine someone trying to find every single entrance in *every single screen* throughout the entire land. It would take longer than a lazy Sunday afternoon to find them all, that's for sure. Now imagine all the entrances that require bombs to access, and how someone would have to keep going through each screen and using them on every section of the wall, in the slim chance an entrance may be there. Then imagine that, when they run out of bombs, they have to keep going back and finding more, in order to experiment with them on the next section of land! We're talking hours and hours of gaming here. Seriously, people back then who wrote NES guides had to be extremely patient and willing to do the same things over and over again in order to find every little thing inside the game.

There's really only ONE minor flaw- on more than one occasion, you'll find yourself inside a room that appears to be exactly the same as a room you've been to before, but with very minor changes separating the two, such as enemies in one room, and nothing in the other room.  That's it.  Some occasional *minor* confusion understanding the difference between a few of the rooms. That's the only problem with the game.  Even then, the game is pretty small so you shouldn't have THAT much of a hard time with it.  You shouldn't be spending THAT much time confused and scratching your head where to go and what to do. There's nothing else to complain about.  The original NES Metroid *is* a classic.  The excellent theme music in EVERY SINGLE AREA OF THE GAME, the constant arcade-style shooting action (and need I remind you that NO other Metroid game gives you *this* much shooting action) the creepy atmosphere of being stuck inside a dark planet with enemies that seem to crawl, fly, or zig zag all OVER the place, constantly.  It's a lot of fun shooting or avoiding these enemies, and the game is so much fun words can't even describe how GREAT the experience is.  Replay value indeed. I was a child in the 80's and remember playing this game over and over as I found new areas and felt the excitement when I finally figured out what I was supposed to do.  Remember the first time we reached that part near the beginning where we had to work our way UP that lengthy blue-colored area with spikey creatures crawling around and rippers flying back and forth?  Remember when we said to ourselves \"Man, is this thing ever going to END or am I supposed to keep climbing forever?\"  And remember when we finally found a door after all that climbing and breathed a sigh of relief?  Didn't you realize this game was something much different from the other NES games at the time?  THAT'S what makes a game a classic. There was nothing else like this game back in the day.  A space shooter that was ALSO an action game with fantastic gameplay, and even a platformer for that matter.  The game requires lots of climbing and exploring.  The music in the more maze-like areas fit *extremely* well with the confusion of trying to find your way out of each area.  Absolutely a great game. Sure, it's short by todays standards, but the two hours it takes for me to blow through the game is time well spent.  The password system was also really cool because you had to write down extremely long passwords.  This is a good thing because there's a mysterious feeling to the dead quiet sound of a password appearing on screen after you were killed. People who dismiss this game are spoiled by either Super Metroid's superior graphics and gameplay, or even worse, spoiled by the drastically different Metroid Prime games.  Remember, I was AROUND in the 80's and got to experience this classic game when it was brand new.  That's why I can appreciate it for the masterpiece it is.  Atmosphere, gameplay, music, memories, that dreaded feeling of hopelessness and fear when you believed you were stuck in certain areas, you name it.  This game has it all, baby. Don't be afraid of a challenge (though I've never believed the game was as difficult as most people) and don't be afraid of a game that's old.

After all, it is the game that began the most popular JRPG series in the world.  Unfortunately, the test of time makes reviewing some NES games particularly hard.  There are plenty of NES games that truly stand the test of time.  The original Super Mario Bros. Trilogy, for instance, are games that still hold up well and aren't dated based on the things they did for their time nearly as much as games such as Ninja Gaiden or the first (but not the other) Mega Man games. That being said, Final Fantasy is one of the games that, while good in its own right, hasn't aged well at all.  It's a good thing there are so many remakes in the future that tweaked a few things.  The original Final Fantasy is a gem of a game for its historical purposes but sometimes you have to admit that time isn't kind to every game.  In the case of Final Fantasy it's mainly small things.  It's a revolutionary game for the NES in other ways (namely presentation) but it's not exactly a game you'd give to someone to start them off on Final Fantasy.  At least not this particular version of it. Even for an NES game, Final Fantasy actually has a great story.  For the younger gamers reading this, however, they might not see it.  Final Fantasy isn't a game that was known for its character development or anything like that.  You create four characters.  Each of whom will be one of six classes.  White Mage, Black Mage, Red Mage, Fighter, Warrior or Thief.  They will be this class for the entire game.  Despite this only their abilities and equipment are really impacted.  Unlike future games certain aspects don't always hold true.  Particularly the thief who does not have the ability to steal.  Yes, others are kept in the same manner you're used to.  But for the most part your melee combatants mostly have stat alterations and equipment.  You'll be able to update the classes later and they'll be stronger, but it takes some time. These four characters are known as the Warriors of Light.  Known in later versions as simply The Light Warriors.  After going off to the light temple to rescue a King's daughter they set out on a quest to find four orbs (they weren't crystals... yet) that represent various elements.  Using these orbs they'll save the world and defeat evil once and for all. What makes the story not stand out like later games is that it's a pretty simple story, but also that the characters are mute the entire time.  As with many games on the NES, the story mostly needed to be interpreted by the player as opposed to things playing out for them.  While this form of storytelling would never hold up in a JRPG today, it's surprisingly coherent in the original Final Fantasy.  Particularly with the games final twist that is actually quite masterful.  Even if you see it coming just the twist alone makes the entire story come full circle and become clear.  Despite the characters not speaking, nor you being given a lot of direction there's definitely a coherent and cohesive story in the original Final Fantasy.  The only downside is that it's not exactly paced very well.  It takes a moment for the story to take up.  Things are only made worse by the fact that as an NES JRPG the emphasis is put a lot more on exploring.  Thus, Final Fantasy doesn't ever really tell you where to go.  You just sort of find out.  If you didn't have a strategy guide or call a handy telephone hotline (yes, this was a thing before internet) then you were likely going to get lost in Final Fantasy and remain lost for several hours at a time.  Unless you're really going to talk to every NPC you can find, you won't find your way through Final Fantasy that easily.  The story itself is actually quite linear, it's just always figuring out how to get there.  You'll encounter moments and puzzles that you'd probably never figure out without help.  But when the game really gets going and your characters get stronger it's manageable. At least if you do stray too far off, you'll know.  As with many NES games, Final Fantasy had a reputation for being quite challenging.  It's battle system is the traditional turn based affair that many NES games utilized.  Combat is done in \"rounds\".  You select all of your characters actions and watch a round of combat play out.  It's simple stuff.  What made Final Fantasy quite dynamic, however, is that it was pushing the NES to its limits.  Even back then Final Fantasy was seeing how far it could push things.  Dragon Quest, the closest contemporary anyone can think of to Final Fantasy, often had battles in the \"first person,\" view.  meaning you saw your enemies but not your allies.  Games like Phantasy Star were similar in that regard.  Final Fantasy, instead, arranged all your allies on one side of the screen and all of your enemies on the other.  You could be attacked by as many as nine enemies at once. Final Fantasy was certainly not easy by any means.  This is where some of its age quirks come in.  In very strange ways.  You can't entirely fault design for it.  The JRPG was still in its infancy and hadn't \"evolved\" to being what it had become in the SNES or Playstation era.  Final Fantasy really made sure you used some kind of strategy.  For instance, if all of your characters targeted an enemy that was always who they would attack... even if they were dead.  So let's say you set all four of your characters to attack an enemy and the first character that attacks kills it.  The other three characters will simply attack where the enemy was.  Thus, they just attack air.  There is no auto targeting.  You need to actually plan this out. Likewise, many old school JRPGs really put an emphasis on grinding.  Where as many a JRPG by today's standards don't have quite the emphasis on gaining levels... Final Fantasy very much does.  You MUST grind to get through Final Fantasy.  The game is not afraid to punish you for neglecting to do so.  If you are having trouble with Final Fantasy, the biggest contributor might be because you believe you can power through it.  If you don't take some time to grind every now and then, Final Fantasy will punish you. The games magic system is also very different from what you know.  Where as many games had an MP system, Final Fantasy had a \"spells per day,\" system.  Meaning that until you rested at an inn there was no way to restore your spell uses.  The higher the level spell, the less amount of times you could cast per day.  Likewise, each LEVEL shares a number.  So it's actually that you can only cast say... nine level one spells per day.  You might only be able to cast ONE level nine spell per day, however.  So you have to be very careful.  This is manageable in and of itself, however. What isn't quite as manageable is that Final Fantasy only allows you to save if you rest at an inn or use a tent or cottage.  Compounding this with the fact that you can't dash in dungeons means that you'll spend a lot of time in dungeons.  There are no save points or anything like that.  Since dungeons were quite lengthy you had to manage your way through them, only casting a limited number of spells and with no real ability to save while in the dungeon.  In some instances this wasn't nearly as bad as it seems.  In others (such as the games incredibly lengthy final dungeon) you really wish you could save.  Especially if you went deep into a dungeon and ran out of resources or found yourself unable to defeat a challenging boss.  As I said, Final Fantasy was not an easy game. It's hard to find grave faults with all this.  Some of these things were mere limitations of the hardware the game was on.  Others were simply because the genre had not evolved much.  None of this necessarily makes Final Fantasy a \"bad\" game.  It just means that the game itself is dated.  Some games travel through time quite well.  Mega Man II, for instance, improved upon the first one in every way and is still hailed as an incredible game thanks to how they really smoothed out the limitations of the first game.  Thus, Mega Man II has actually aged considerably well.  Final Fantasy didn't exactly have anything that came before for them to really see if what they were doing was necessarily \"wrong\" or \"unfair\" to begin with.  At the time, Square wasn't known for making RPGs and the genre itself was still relatively new at a time where platformers were still king.  In the late 80's it's hard to say these would've really been considered \"problems\" for the original Final Fantasy.  It's not like there was much for Final Fantasy to compare itself to. On the other hand, Final Fantasy is one of the best looking NES games out there.  The size of the game for an NES game is incredible.  Games like The Legend of Zelda are really the only ones that can compare in length (or another Final Fantasy).  It also has a great soundtrack composed by Nobuo Uematsu.  It's amazing how catchy and simple these tinny tunes are.  Presentation wise, Final Fantasy never disappoints on the hardware it debuts on.  This was no different. If Final Fantasy is too dated for some gamers you're in luck.  Square just can't seem to stop releasing Final Fantasy.  But in and outside of Japan.  You can find Final Fantasy Origins on the Playstation (or the PSN for PS3, Vita and PSP owners) where the games has improved graphics, sound and fixes the strange \"attacking air,\" issue.  Or you can find it on the PSP where it's, again, be revamped and reworked.  Or you can find what is, in my opinion, the best version.  The one on the GBA.  The reason the GBA one is the best version is that it not only fixes all the \"dated\" issues, but also allows you to save anywhere, replaces the \"spells per day,\" with an actual MP system and it includes bonus dungeons and bosses.  It also comes packaged with Final Fantasy II.  The PSP version of the game does NOT include Final Fantasy II.  All of these versions are quite a bit superior to the original NES version.  The only real reason to play it on the NES would be nostalgia sake.  It's a game worth checking out for the die-hard Final Fantasy fan who really wants to explore the series roots.  However, I would highly suggest going for one or the reissues of the game where they were more than willing to tweak and work on some things. Final Fantasy isn't a bad game.  It's just one that is dated.  For older gamers, they won't have many problems with it.  For younger gamers I imagine some may wonder what all the fuss was about, or even be frustrated by some of its limitations.</td><td>Some Games Age Better Than Others.</td><td>1057363200</td><td>1</td><td>2019</td><td>8558</td><td>143</td><td>4.2387320455671125</td><td>14.118881118881118</td><td>0.08261042</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>15189</td><td>5.0</td><td>14</td><td>false</td><td>07 18, 2003</td><td>B00004SVYF</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>OK, I'm a little sick of my peers (ages 13-19) giving old skool games low ratings because they aren't up to \"todays\" standards or because they're \"too old\" to be fun anymore. I'm a 16 year old gamer and actually prefer old-skool myself. I think it's time we start reviewing a product for what it really IS rahter than how old it is. For its time, Metroid was a milestone in video gaming. One of the largest games when it was released that wasn't quite so linear. The game doesn't have a completely set path for you to take. You're supposed to get around by exploring the game and finding abilities. It is possible to find nearly every ability before you even fight your first boss.  This was also one of the first games to use the \"Password\" system. There were probably a a few before this. Also, what I like most about this game (and what the games these days need) is that its HARD! Should you play this game you'll be stunned at some of its difficult feets. Some things you must do to get abilities are amazingly hard, but well worth it. For 8-bit graphics these are amazing and some of the best on the NES I've seen.  This is by far one of the best NES games you could ever get.  The game is also HUGE that you MUST explore. If (when?) you die you always get a password displayed. Depending on what area you're in will depend on where you start.  For the NES using this system was a bit different at the time. Metroid is a milestone among games. Not to mention it had one of the most shocking moments in videogame history (that when I played, I myself was a bit shocked at the time), that being that Samus is a woman.  Sure nowadays its no big deal but when Metroid came out all the big heroes in games were male characters back in this time.  So while today it isn't shocking to see, back then it was. Overall, you'd have to be crazy not to be able to enjoy this game. Unless of course you're like most of my friends who could care less about the gameplay and more about the graphics.

No that really isn't anything bad considering most games in that time you couldn't aim diagnolly. So I guess there's nothing bad I could say about this game. Except that some of the glitches the NES cartridge tends to have sometimes. -The other con...its too bad that compared to today it won't get what it deserves anymore.

It's not just a find-100-of-this game either - there are combinations of things to do, and puzzles to solve, creatures to rescue and mazes to explore The mini-games are amazingly fun by themselves. My boyfriend got hooked on the kickball game and kept going back for more! There are more egg varieties, more jinjos of various colors, more of everything.

I had no idea this game was some kind of cinematic adventure with emphasis on story elements.  I'd have rather the game just focused on the levels themselves and skipped over the storyline completely since it's uninteresting, confusing, needlessly character-oriented and unnecessarily elaborate for such a short game (less than an hour long). Not only that but the story elements play similar to reading a comic book and let me tell ya something, I *hate* comic books since I can almost never find myself feeling connected with the characters.  I don't care what happens to Ryu (the ninja), his father, the masked devil, the demon statues or the black moon.  All this nonsense would've been better off dismissed. Anyway the levels themselves are alright but then another problem arises- the challenge is so high that it's impossible to really enjoy the experience.  If animals and birds aren't charging you from behind at lightning speed giving you no time to respond, it seems that whenever you're about to land safely on a platform below, it's at that exact point an enemy makes a surprise appearance and a cheap attack on you.  It's really annoying how these two scenarios happen time and time again so I really have no choice but to deduct points on the overall rating for that. Your ninja character gets a sword and he's very efficient with it.  His ability to climb walls reminds me of the Mega Man X series and I love it since it's a nifty way to get around.  The gameplay moves at a remarkably fast pace which has to be somewhat of a surprise considering the year this game was released is 1989 and most gaming characters were still slow at that point (especially NES ones).  The enemies are quite animated considering the games age and you'll often find kickboxing, axe tossing or bazooka soldiers trying to take you out (and often succeeding!) The boss fights is where the challenge gets downright crazy and impossible for someone of average gaming skills (like me).  The last few bosses will bring even the best gamers to tears since the game is all about lucking out and hoping their attacks don't hit you before you hit them.  That's basically the key to the entire game in fact- move fast, stay ahead and be in control.  Otherwise you'll fall behind and take unnecessary hits from the swarming enemy danger.  Perhaps if the game was more generous with your life meter and let you take at least 10 hits before death it wouldn't have been a problem.  The music is mostly forgettable except for a couple themes, and the levels are nothing but basic areas such as caves, snow, city streets, oceans, mountains, etc. Overall a decent game but honestly I prefer Castlevania's challenge more.</td><td>big bad ninja dude</td><td>1409875200</td><td>0</td><td>499</td><td>2307</td><td>20</td><td>4.623246492985972</td><td>24.95</td><td>-0.026</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>15226</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>09 22, 2003</td><td>B00004SVV9</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>Many will no doubt praise this as the greatest Mario game of all time. To be truthful, of the Mario trilogy on the NES I don't know which one to choose as the best (but #2 let me play as Toad and Peach so that's probably the best one). They were all awesome games that I'll never forget and this vast one really stands out. Super Mario Brothers 3 had the biggest selling video game release for years to come. While Super Mario Brothers 1 still remains the best selling game of all time, Super Mario Brothers 3 had the biggest selling release from 1990 to 1999. Unfortunately it's record was broken in 1999 by Final Fantasy VIII I believe. First of all, let me remind EVERY gamer out there that this game certainly wouldn't stand a chance today with the more 128 bit systems (or would it?) around.  Second, it was made in 1990! Why do gamers constantly try and compare old classics with today's standards in areas that they KNOW old classics can't match (Graphics, lentgh, sound etc.)?  Forget that the game isn't what we'd get today and remember what it WAS back then! A great classic game to remember without a doubt and you'll never regret a moment you had with this game.  The gameplay is fun and the worlds get enormously huge as you go on. Not only that but this game presents a great challenge. EVEN for today's standards the game is still hard.

The MegaMan series is known for its amazing graphics, awesome gameplay mechanics, precise controls, and frustrating difficulty. MegaMan 2 has all that. You choose from 8 different robot masters, selecting your own order of levels. The level designs are as creative as ever. However, they are also very hard. Luckily, killing certain enemies might give you an orb to restore your health. Or better yet, if you're lucky enough, a 1up! Unfortunately, that won't save you from having to go through Heat Man's puzzling disappearing blocks. Dr. Wily's stage is a total pain in the neck, too. Deathtraps are set here and there. But still, MegaMan 2 is one the best and most frustrating NES games ever.

It may not have a fantastic plot, but those of us who remember the NES days weren't too concerned with plot anyway (remember, you were Mario going to rescue the Princess from the clutches of King Koopa).  Mega Man II introduced a few things to the series that the first one lacked.  The biggest new assest was perhaps the Energy Tank.  While you could only carry four, it was nice that for once I didn't have to go back and forth killing enemies for energy pellets. The gameplay was a step up for this.  Mega Man II also has more balanced difficulty.  It isn't just the energy tanks, it's that you're more likely to survive in cases where you can't.  There are eight robot masters as opposed to six, and the weapons are a little better.  The element of Robot Masters being weak to other Robot Master weapons is still there, and it works out even better here than it did in the first one.  It's a bit more unpredictable. The difficulty may be balanced, but it isn't by any means the hardest of the Mega Man series (the first one is).  It's actually one of the easier ones in the series.  The bulk of the difficulty may come from Quick Man's stage, and even that can be taken care of quite easily.  Taking on the robot masters a second time is also pretty easy when you've got all their weapons to use against them, and they always drop an energy pellet that restores probably more damage than they'll do to you.  In other words, the game is not a challenge.  There are still moments where it's difficult, but for the most part, unlike the first game, it seems more managable than the first game. The music is also a lot better, and so are the graphics.  There are fewer graphical glitches, and the music gets stuck in your head for a long time.  Mega Man II is a huge step above the original Mega Man in all respects.  It plays better, it's not nearly as difficult (even on the difficult setting) and has fantastic music to boot.  This is the Mega Man game that serves as the staple for the series.</td><td>The BEST of the Original Series!</td><td>1150416000</td><td>1</td><td>404</td><td>1660</td><td>23</td><td>4.108910891089109</td><td>17.565217391304348</td><td>0.16611058</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>15301</td><td>5.0</td><td>3</td><td>false</td><td>12 15, 2005</td><td>B00004SVS3</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Younger Mega Man fans won't know just how popular and fun this game was back in the day, and how the years have gone by and the game is STILL a lot of fun. So many positive things can be said about Mega Man 2. The fantastic theme music, which is still the best music in a Mega Man game to date. Every single tune in this game is amazingly creative and memorable. If you don't think so you're crazy. Another thing that fascinates me is how people can never decide which of the first three Mega Man games is the best one. The first one I have never played, but they say it's extremely challenging, and because it only features 6 bosses, I don't think it's possible for me to prefer that one over Mega Man 2. Then we have Mega Man 3, which video game fans like to compete with Mega Man 2 to find out just which game delivers the ultimate Mega Man experience. Many people will try to say 3 is the best NES Mega Man game, while many others will say the clear winner is the 2nd one. Which one do I prefer? I have played 3, and while that one was also a fun, addicting action game, I think this one tops it. It doesn't smear it, it just beats it. The level design and the weapons Mega Man can equip just excite me more in this game. The creative juices were really flowing here. Mega Man 2, despite Capcom probably not completely sure if the Mega Man name will take off or not, marks where everything fell into place for the series and it feels SO MUCH like a classic because everything about this game feels so right. Mega Man 3 feels more like \"just another Mega Man game\" (though a great one- it just doesn't have that special feel, though of course many would disagree). Mega Man 4 is also a good game to own, and by the time Mega Man 5 was released it felt like players were thinking to themselves \"ok Capcom, that's enough!\". But really, all 5 of those NES Mega Man games are probably worth owning. I also have never played the 6th installment. People don't seem to like that one so you may want to avoid it. From the small amount of pictures I have seen of the game, it does look different from the previous 5. Though graphics aren't everything, so who knows if I'd like it or not. I really don't have any complaints with Mega Man 2. It's a lot of fun playing this game 15 years after I first rented and eventually bought. I can't remember where I bought it. Probably a yard sale. Back in the day you could buy NES games used at yard sales, garage sales and whatnot for extremely cheap prices. Just think, there was a point where I probably would have only had to pay a dollar for the first Mega Man game. Wow, it's definitely not like that today. I'm still angry that the video store in my town always had the Mega Man 1 cardboard box on the shelf, and when I took the box up to the man behind the counter so I could rent the game, I was always disappointed to find that the game was never available because someone never returned it, and to this day I never got to play it. Mega Man 2 offers a nice challenge, but unlike many NES games it's actually possible to beat this game with some practice. That's how a challenging game should be- hard at first, and the more you play the better you get. With practice you WILL beat this game, because there's really no place in any of the levels that can be called frustrating. Just a nice small challenge all the way through. This game has it all, folks. Great level design, fantastic music, weapons and bosses that make you want to keep coming back to it again and again.

It's not exactly a BAD game, but it's very weak in comparison to its 16-Bit counterparts. All of the cars move too slowly for any enjoyment out of speed, and the races tend to drag. The music is also a big step down. Gone are the gritty, catchy, and radically memorable tunes, and in are exclusive, just okay-ish songs. All of the game's mechanics are still there, though - Using nitros to move a little faster and purchasing upgrades are all present and accounted for, and they work just as fine.

The graphics were improved and were well-created in its time and on the NES. The sounds were even better, although some were recycled (No complaints about that, though). The gameplay was a truckload of awesomism. New powerups, new levels, new experiences, etc! 2-Player mode was incredible compared to the one in SMB1. As you both play as Mario and Luigi, you guys can clear levels for each other (Or just die on purpose so the other player can play the harder levels), and you can battle each other in a recreation of the Mario Bros arcade game. You either knock down 5 enemies, get 5 coins, distract the other player, or jump on him/her to take the panels they collected at the end of the regular levels.

What an unbelievable piece of overrated garbage Super Mario Bros. 3 is.  For the life of me I don't get the appeal of this game.  Through each of the eight boring worlds it's just the same thing every time: run to the end of each and every extremely short, uncreative level collecting worthless crap so you can move on to the next short, uncreative level.  Super Mario Bros. 3 is complete baboon poop.  It really is.  Nothing good about this game at all.  No reason for Mario or video game fans to remember this crappy adventure.  No reason for this game to exist.  Thank God there are sensible people out there such as myself to give you the honest truth. Let's get right to the point and talk about all the stinky things: One, and this is the biggest reason Super Mario Bros. 3 isn't any good.  You can only play as Mario and Luigi.  In Super Mario Bros. 2 you can play as the Princess and Toad in addition to Mario and Luigi.  Not so here.  In this game, Mario and Luigi don't even have anything unique to separate the two, so they are basically the same exact person (except Mario is red and Luigi is green).  Remember how high Luigi can jump in Super Mario Bros. 2?  Well now he jumps just like Mario.  Absolutely no reason for this.  If anything, Luigi should have MANY more interesting things about him this time around since, after all, Super Mario Bros. 3 comes AFTER Super Mario Bros. 2 and you'd think the most logical thing would be to continue adding MORE things with each new series.  But in this case, you get less.  I guess Nintendo FORGOT to make Luigi stand apart from Mario. Another problem: this game is so freakin' predictable.  Gee, after the desert world I go to... a water world?  You don't say!  What?  There's an ICE world and a plant world coming up?  No way!  And what's THIS I see?  The final world will be BIG DARK EVIL FIRE WORLD?  I didn't see THAT coming.  Thanks Nintendo, for making Mario fans look like complete idiots.  Way to go. Other serious problems become noticeable after a couple hours of playtime such as the fact that you have to do so much boring jumping in this game.  You have to jump on top of (or over) SO many things that it becomes an absolute chore after world 3 (if you even MAKE it that far without shutting off the game, that is).  If you find anything exciting about jumping over pipes or jumping on top of goombas or picking up and kicking buzzy beetles, then I recommend seeking professional help. Ok, what else makes Super Mario Bros. 3 suck so much?  It can't get any worse, right?  Yes it can.  After you beat the game a message comes up on the screen that says \"Thank you, but our princess is in another castle.  Just kidding, hahaha\".  You mean to tell me, after all that long, hard and tedious work making it to the very end, Nintendo is going to joke around and make like the adventure isn't over yet?  Before the \"just kidding\" part, you might very well rip apart your controller or punch a hole in your TV screen all because Nintendo wants to play around and pretend there's still more to the adventure.  I can't even think of appropriate words to describe how angry this makes me.  Tears of anger are almost dripping down my face.  Nintendo NEVER should have done that.  I bet that most people who first seen that message really thought the princess was in another castle and came THIS close to killing the nearest living thing next to them.  Bad Nintendo. And guess what?  You have to face one of Bowser's kids at the end of every world.  I'm not kidding.  I was honestly expecting to fight Bowser's WIFE before fighting him, but it never happened.  That's probably for the better.  Who knows how horrific she looks. I'm still trying to figure out what everyone sees in this game.  It's old and forgettable.  Honestly, I think nowadays the only people who enjoy Super Mario Bros. 3 are older folks whose children have moved away to college or to start a family, and they left behind their NES and Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge so their parents had something to do.  All these older folks miraculously happen to enjoy the game so now EVERYONE acts like it's the best game of all-time.  Well it's not.</td><td>bad game</td><td>1151366400</td><td>1</td><td>829</td><td>3431</td><td>60</td><td>4.138721351025332</td><td>13.816666666666666</td><td>0.010921051</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>15440</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>08 1, 2014</td><td>B00004SVYI</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Usually I start off 4 or 5 star reviews on a happy note, but not this time.  It brings me great sadness to inform you guys that despite being given Startropics for free when I was younger in 1994-95, I ended up selling it to Funcoland a few years later.  My reason is because the play control is absolutely horrible.  Unforgivably horrible.  It seems Mike, the character, doesn't jump or walk correctly at all and it's very awkward since I managed to work with many other NES games back in the day that eventually controlled perfectly fine after a little determination and a willingness not to give up too soon.  Startropics however, never cooperated.  It's not like I usually complain about play control in games either.  Other than the map screen from Skate or Die, this is the only other game where the movements gave me a lot of difficulty. However it's 19 years later.  Things change right?  Yes they do!  I now realize that what I originally disliked about this game... well the play control is still really bad unfortunately, but I'm now more willing to work with it due to the fact the internet has shown me the error of my ways given the many reviews expressing enthusiasm for this game, and that Startropics is actually a decent game after all.  It's basically a little charming island adventure and nothing more.  The dolphin quest near the beginning basically confirms Startropics is full of charm, though after experiencing this little moment of happiness, it may surprise some that the tone and intensity of the adventure changes drastically later on.  It's mostly a linear experience though, so for people who love Crystallis and the Legend of Zelda... this game might not be for you I'm afraid.  Maybe the characters are memorable enough to persuade Crytallis and Zelda lovers to check out Startropics though. Speaking of Zelda, this game shares quite a bit of similarities to the first Legend of Zelda.  You have a heart meter for one thing, and while it only happens occasionally, you even pick up heart pieces too (cleverly hidden throughout the islands instead of after defeating a boss).  You battle snakes and ghosts in the many dungeon-like caves that totally feel like they were copy and pasted out of the first Legend of Zelda game, but that's probably where the comparisons end because in Startropics you also have mummies, harpoons/blades coming out of the floors, rolling boulders, skeletons, skeleton heads, octopuses, bullets shooting all over the place and later on robots.  A very nice variety if I do say so. The storyline about \"evil aliens\" coming to this island isn't much but it's enjoyable for what it is.  I love how you're mostly roaming around one normal island after another talking to different people before heading into another dangerous cave.  There's slight touches of alien or robot activity occurring every so often (such as your robot pal who can take you around the islands).  The characters are charming and more memorable than other games (even Zelda).  You'll be spending at least half of your time roaming the islands and talking to the townspeople.  The island theme is in full swing and well done, and the banana jokes are usually funny.  The music is AMAZING!  The credits them at the end makes me cry it's so beautiful.  Adding meaningful pictures related to your journey as the music plays here just makes the adventure feel even more fulfilling. Anyway the dungeon-like caves are absolutely some of the HARDEST areas I've ever played in an NES game.  While these caves are normally straight forward with secrets that aren't that confusing to figure out, and while they're mostly short with linear paths, the challenge comes in a REALLY BIG way when you realize that simply taking one hit from an enemy knocks off 2 or more hearts from your life meter.  This means it's entirely possible to be dead in 3-4 hits.  Yes you have to be *extremely* careful how you approach the danger here, and unfortunately when the challenge increases in the second half of the game, you'll be raging quite often trust me.  The puzzles are surprisingly clever.  You'll be spending a significant amount of your time jumping Michael from blocks/switches to more blocks/switches, which dominates the majority of the cave puzzles.  These block jumps/switch steps are done in ways that can reveal hidden items or hidden important pathways, or something more approachable such as figuring your way across the other side of the room. Overall I enjoy Startropics but it's not a game I recommend playing often due to the incredibly high challenge and atrocious play control.  The robots are relentless near the end too.  They will shoot and shoot and not give you any breathing room.  Expect flying pellets to come from all kinds of directions- not just the robots but other enemies, and it reminds me of Gradius quite a bit (and I never did particularly well in Gradius, heh).  At least your heart meter increases like in Zelda making it less stressful for the gamer since you're given slightly more leeway, but you'll STILL be taking all kinds of hits and facing all kinds of danger.  The game only gets harder as it goes on.  Also on another note, is this the first NES game to automatically save your progress before you enter a cave/dungeon?  I can't think of any other NES game that saves your progress automatically like that. Boss fights are just as bad, if not worse.  Actually they're definitely worse because you can easily lose a life by simply standing in the wrong place at the wrong time, and get caught in a situation where your health goes down quickly.  Yikes! There's one boss where you have to jump across stepping stone blocks while avoiding his shooting pellets and it seems while jumping from block to block you're jumping *over* his attacks but a lot of times avoiding danger in such a way is completely unintentional on your part which makes me conclude you probably need luck on your side to master this game.  Because of these challenge problems, I really think Startropics is one of the hardest NES games available.  Certainly the hardest of the Zelda-like adventure genre.  Still, if you're open-minded enough to accept such a challenge, go for it.  This is a pretty awesome game despite the high difficulty.</td><td>tropical adventure</td><td>1406851200</td><td>0</td><td>1115</td><td>5153</td><td>54</td><td>4.62152466367713</td><td>20.64814814814815</td><td>0.033266034</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>15450</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>12 20, 2003</td><td>B00004SWL9</td><td>N.

Containing 56 fighters from the Marvel comics universe (including Spider-Man, Wolverine, Captain America, Iron Man, and Cable) and the Capcom universe (Ryu, Felicia, Mega Man, Jill Valentine, and Captain Commando), and a plethora of possible combos and tag team variations, Marvel VS Capcom 2 takes Capcom's outline of tag fighters and up's the ante in virtually every way possible.  Unlike some of the Street Fighter games and even the first Marvel VS Capcom, you can't just button mash your way through the game.  Learning the various special moves, timing, and techniques for tag team pummeling will prove essential if you hope to get anywhere in the game.  The 2-D fighters are superbly animated, while the 3-D backgrounds look great as well.  There is hardly a single flaw in Marvel VS Capcom 2, which is one of the reasons why this game is so hard to find (if you ever find this game and you still own a Dreamcast, pick this up, you won't regret it).  All in all, for those few Dreamcast owners out there, this is an absolute must have.</td><td>One of, if not the, best 2-D fighters ever</td><td>1071878400</td><td>1</td><td>228</td><td>1035</td><td>8</td><td>4.5394736842105265</td><td>28.5</td><td>0.11853968</td><td>805</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>15472</td><td>5.0</td><td>12</td><td>false</td><td>11 6, 2006</td><td>B00004SVQR</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Iron Sword is actually Wizards and Warriors Part 2.  You can tell because the main character (a sword-swinging knight) is the same guy from the previous game. In this adventure, you are no longer treated to infinite continues.  This means the challenge is EXACTLY right.  I can make it to the end of the game, but even after all these years I was never able to beat it.  That final boss is HARD. This game is probably better than the original if only because you now get to explore forest, water, ice and fire worlds.  Yeah, I know, EVERY game seems to have those kind of levels.  Remember, back in the late 80's a game like this was pretty influential and certainly unique.  We were NOT exposed to countless games that were merely rip-offs of other games, unlike today, where it seems like platform games are basically a thing of the past. Thanks to the lack of creative ideas to make something fresh in the world of platform gaming, people are now sick of the genre.  The fact that everyone is now obsessed with realism in gaming means that an overwhelming obsession with a game like Iron Sword will never return.  That makes the game stand out in a positive way, in my opinion. I *strongly* believe, as crazy as this might sound, that the music in Iron Sword is the VERY BEST music a video game can possibly have.  Yes, I know I'm *extremely* crazy for thinking this way, but it's true.  I can't believe music THIS good even exists.  Heck, I probably never would have even had an obsession with music if I never had encountered this excellent game. I put the music in this game on the same level as the music from my favorite bands, like the Moody Blues.  Iron Sword features melodic themes that actually keep building and building in melodies and musical ideas, something 95% of other NES games didn't do.  Most NES games kept repeating the same couple notes over and over.  Not so in Iron Sword.  It's music on a whole other level.  Almost like progressive rock music.  Some of the programmers must have been fans of Genesis or Yes. As for the gameplay, it's basically the same as the previous game except now, as I said above, you explore a variety of different worlds.  The challenge has been increased a lot.  You have to be careful not to die too many times or else you will have to return to the beginning of the game.  Not really a bad thing, though.  After all, NES games were challenging, and that's what made the games so addicting- we kept coming back to them despite dying repeatedly.  If you were to compare the challenge in Iron Sword to other NES games, I'd say it's not so hard then.  But if you want to compare Iron Sword to, oh I don't know, Resident Evil 4, Iron Sword is a pretty tough cookie then. Overall, jumping around on high platforms slashing enemies never gets old when it's done correctly.  Thanks to the wonderful graphics and play control, I truly love this game.</td><td>the adventure continues</td><td>1162771200</td><td>1</td><td>551</td><td>2346</td><td>34</td><td>4.257713248638838</td><td>16.205882352941178</td><td>0.014142894</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A29BQ6B90Y1R5F</td><td>15521</td><td>4.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 17, 2000</td><td>B00004SWM0</td><td>Tsanche</td><td>Squaresoft was having quite a time in the year 2000.  They released a lot of good fun and classics games.  Among them were Vagrant Story, Chrono Cross, Final Fantasy IX and Threads of Fate to name a few.  Legend of Mana came around and was a well liked game by quite a few who were quite taken with Secret of Mana years prior.  That being said, Legend of Mana was a great game that holds up well today that is mostly troubled by strange problems more so than big ones. There's no overall plot to Legend of Mana.  In fact, the game in and of itself has a storybook like feel.  You'll choose a character (boy or girl) and give him or her a weapon (it doesn't matter which).  After that you'll pick a spot in the world to occupy and start building.  The system at work here is a pretty complex but can be quite nice at times.  You build on a world map by taking artifacts and placing them. Once you do a new area on the map will spring up for you to venture to.  Legend of Mana is very much a dungeon crawler by every respect.  By going to new locations or speaking to people in towns you've built from your artifacts you'll be able to start missions, which are usually stories in and of themselves.  Each has a beginning and end.  Usually ending with you defeating a boss and often collecting an artifact.  There are a lot of missions.  Some are as simple as finding the right person and speaking to them.  Others are more complex, having you crawling through dungeons to defeat bosses and to return certain items to other characters.  They're varied in structure.  You might get an action heavy story that has you in several battles only to later help someone by simply running about a town and talking to various citizens.  There might not be a single battle in this instance.  It gives a nice varied pace to Legend of Mana. You'll also help out some who may later open up various secrets.  For instance, after completing one mission I unlocked a workshop that allowed me to create and temper weapons.  And to get the best of the best requires a lot of work and grinding to do. Just because Legend of Mana doesn't have an OVERALL plot doesn't mean there aren't plot threads within it.  Many missions you undergo lead to other missions to continue a particular narrative at work.  It may seem like Niccolo is nothing special from his first mission, but stick with him and it becomes quite an interesting story arc.  There are many minor characters who have big involved stories.  There are three different story arcs in particular that you can view that will get you to the endgame itself.  And they are by far the three most involving, heartbreaking and well told stories of the lot.  The first involves a mysterious girl named Pearl and her partner Elazul from the dying race of Jumi.  A jewel thief named Sandra steals their jewel which kills them.  Your role in this quest is to stop her and save the Jumi race from dying out entirely.  The second involves two Dragoons, Larc and Sierra and a lord named Drakonis who must be stopped from taking over the world.  The last story arc involves Escad, Matilda, Irwin and Deana as their friendshps cripple and war between humans and faeries seems inevitable. All three of those arcs are extremely good stories.  That being said, it's a shame that none of these subplots and stories ever come together to form a main storyline.  For quite some time the main objective of the game is fairly unclear.  And without a walkthrough of some sort you'll find it particularly hard to get to the endgame as the path to get there isn't exactly straightforward.  And the lack of an overall plot means there are very few hints on how to get there or even what exactly you're searching for to get there.  At the very least most of the stories are fairly good in and of themselves. Gameplay wise, Legend of Mana is a lot more straightforward than most games.  For gamers who were quite impressed with Secret of Mana's action oriented battle system they'll be surprised to know the approach here is a lot different.  Legend of Mana plays more like a beat 'em up at times than an actual RPG.  By that I mean that before battle your characters run around quite normally.  When enemies are encountered you'll enter battle mode and pull out your weapons.  You'll have to beat up the baddies before you can press on.  The screen will also no longer scroll at that time.  Your HP is shown in percentages as opposed to a numerical value as in other RPGs.  In battle mode you'll be able to use abilities and techniques.  This may, in fact be the most overlooked (and important part) of Legend of Mana.  The abilities you equip start as things like only being able to jump and crouch, but later you get more of them.  And these play a role in helping you learn battle techniques.  As you battle and deal damage a gauge under you HP gauge fills up.  When full you can initiate special attacks.  The only way to learn these special techniques, however, is if you are willing to mix and match your abilities.  Likewise, special techniques are also based on weapons.  So a sword will learn a whole different set of special techniques than a dagger.  This gives A LOT of variety to Legend of Mana's battle system. You'll sometimes run around on your own, but on occasion you'll be joined by a partner that you can recruit.  Most partners only stick around for a brief amount of time or until they're dismissed.  It's possible to run around all of Legend of Mana will two partners at all times.  It's a good thing too, because Legend of Mana supports multiplayer.  While you control the main hero your ally will control the other.  And if you both have Legend of Mana data on your memory cards you can import your partners character or jump into his game with yours. The battles themselves are fine, but Legend of Mana can certainly be repetitive to play after a while.  When getting into battles with your enemies there is no way to simply skip them should you be tired of battling.  You can't \"run\" from battle.  They must always be fought 'til the end.  In some instances this will be extremely annoying.  Especially because enemies respond the moment you leave the area and return.  In some dungeons this can make battling feel like a chore.  In others it can just feel downright exhausting.  At least you always start a battle at full HP.  Likewise your HP will also regenerate if you're not taking too much damage in battle (or you use the crouch ability).  That being said, Legend of Mana is not a difficult game at all.  If you fall in battle you can start it over right on the spot.  If something should go wrong in a battle it's fairly easy to recover.  You can also get a lot of experience in some areas by constantly running in and out of the same rooms. On the other hand, your AI controlled allies are not smart at all.  At least you don't have to babysit them.  For two reasons.  The first is that if they die in battle after a little while they'll be automatically revived.  The second is that most encounters won't last too long for them to be a problem anyway.  It's impossible for them to deplete their reserves of MP.  They also have special attacks of their own.  Everything they do is independent of you, but you needn't restore them to full power ever.  They can be fairly good at soaking up damage at least, but for the most part they're not too useful in battle. Legend of Mana isn't a hard game to get through.  Depending on how many quest you can do it can be very short (around five or six hours) or really long, but you're not likely to spend much more than 20-30 hours.  And that's upon choosing do to every quest.  There are some things to extend the time, but not much.  There's a lot of tempering with your weapons and armor, but given the nature of how Legend of Mana is there isn't really such a thing as a \"sidequest\" and there aren't really any mini-games to play through.  In the way of extra content, Legend of Mana only offers a New Game+ where you'll carry over all your equipment and you'll have a chance to increase the difficulty level of the game.  Aside from that, Legend of Mana isn't a game that's filled with an untold number of secrets or sidequests.  There is already a lot in the way of quests as it is.  And since not all of them need to be done to complete the game everything within it can be tackled at your leisure. Graphically, Legend of Mana may be the best example of what it means for a game to be aesthetically pleasing.  A lot of gamers don't seem to realize that graphics are really nothing more than pixels.  The aesthetics is what gives the game the visual characteristics you associate with it.  Legend of Mana is not a graphically powerful game, but it sure does have a lot of great aesthetic quality.  There are few Playstation games that have aged as well as Legend of Mana.  The game looks absolutely gorgeous in every way.  There are no blocky pixels.  Everything in it is handrawn and hand crafted with sprites and artistic backgrounds.  This makes Legend of Mana look better than many of its contemporaries of the day.  It might not be as powerful as Chrono Cross, Final Fantasy IX or Vagrant Story, but it most certainly is a lot easier on the eyes fourteen years later than those particular games.  The art style is simply an assault on the senses.  To put it one way, many Playstation games had an artists rendition of a character that you saw (the way they were supposed to look) but given the power of the Playstation couldn't exactly make them look like that.  Since Legend of Mana utilizes sprites as opposed to polygons every character actually DOES look like the artist rendition.  And this makes the game look extremely good.  The artstyle doesn't just stop with character sprites.  The scenery, spells, special techniques and special movies are all illustrated this way.  Legend of Mana is simply gorgeous.  Complimenting the fantastic art style is a near perfect soundtrack.  From a presentation standpoint it's hard to find fault with Legend of Mana. All that being said, Legend of Mana is a good game.  The gripes I have with it aren't big, they're just strange.  It's hard to criticize the overall plot when the game doesn't present one to us to begin with.  Likewise, with battling, there's nothing inherently \"wrong\" with the battle system, it just happens to get more repetitive than other games.  Overall Legend of Mana is a good game, but it might not necessarily be the greatest to come out of the Mana franchise.</td><td>Small Tidbits Keep it From Being as Legendary as Secret of Mana</td><td>969148800</td><td>0</td><td>2011</td><td>8511</td><td>124</td><td>4.232222774738936</td><td>16.217741935483872</td><td>0.11993549</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A2TCG2HV1VJP6V</td><td>15549</td><td>5.0</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>03 25, 2011</td><td>B00004SVS7</td><td>Ryan Sil. (Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>I'm actually surprised. At first, I was kinda losing hope for this game after hearing that it wasn't as good as MegaMan 3 or 2. But you know what? The people that said those things were wrong. MegaMan 6 was totally worth it. As always, you have eight robot masters to fight. You know what's different here? Two of these guys were actually made by the FANS rather than the creators! Nintendo Power (the magazine) held a contest for designing new robot masters. The winners' robots in this game were Knight Man and Wind Man. Congratulations, guys. The basic gameplay is fun and unharmed in this game. In fact, there are cool new additions here, such as using Rush as a new set of armor. Using the armor, you can either fly (That comes in handy at times) or use super strength. Other fun elements include charging up your Mega Buster and sliding through gaps. While the game is fun, the story feels a little lacking for some reason. In this game, a new villain named Mr. X has attempted to take over, but as it just so turns out, it was Dr. Wily's doing all along. I feel like since this IS the 6th game, it would be expected that Dr. Wily would be doing all this. After all, we are aware that he is a mainstay to the series. As with all of Capcom's 8-Bit games, the graphics are extremely detailed and cool. The music is also well-composed, but I'm not sure if it will remain to be as memorable as the early MegaMan games' soundtracks. But overall, this is a great game and I think you should go buy it.

The gameplay really isn't as fun or exciting as the reality of the actual game show itself. Not always in this particular case. With some game shows, they have to really seem to fit the right key. That right key came with Family Feud and Louie Anderson. Although Louie is no longer the host of Family Feud, and Richard Karn of Home Improvement fame is, Louie brought a realistic sense of humor that blended in uniquely and to the fullest sense of the survey. With Family Feud for the P.C., you get a choice from 5 families to choose from to play for the big bucks. But, if you aren't satisfied with those families, you can always make your own family with the create a family option. The game is exactly the same as Louie used to host the feud. Still, he seems a little mild-mannered during the game, but shows a better sense of humor at the end, with a little dance he pulls to say goodbye. Otherwise, the game also includes several other features to the mix, including a question level difficulty, and a adjustable time limit on all questions. Still, unlike some game show hosts, Louie looks a little more realistic than the actual contestants. That is really no surprise there. The game also includes something that really isn't in the box, fun. This is actually fun. I just still don't understand that when it comes to game shows making it for the P.C. there are always flaws. When it comes to Wheel Of Fortune, all you see is Vanna and no Pat Sajak. When it comes to Millionaire, it seems more like the newer version without Regis Philbin. When Pyramid was released in 2001, the game really wasn't like the actual game show. Unlike those game shows, Family Feud hits it exactly right.

All in all, this isn't a game for novice gamers, but for those who have played Ecco games of the past and look for challenging and lengthy gameplay will have plenty to look forward to here.</td><td>One of the most visually impressive games for the DC</td><td>1051488000</td><td>1</td><td>189</td><td>868</td><td>7</td><td>4.592592592592593</td><td>27.0</td><td>0.1941228</td><td>805</td></tr><tr><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>15740</td><td>5.0</td><td>5</td><td>false</td><td>12 4, 2001</td><td>B00004TBGT</td><td>N.

Demolition Racer was a game that would come out a few years later for the PS1 with basically the same premise and was just as fun.  Now enter Demolition Racer: No Exit for the Dreamcast, an insanely fun (for the most part) racer that was a nice addition to the DC's overbloated racing library.  The premise stays the same, smash up other cars as much as you can while trying to keep your car from getting junked.  You can either race or enter the Demolition League where you can participate in all kinds of other races like Chicken, Last Man Standing, and No Exit which has you and a bunch of other cars confined in a small arena where the last car functioning wins.  Controls are tight and solid, the sound effects are half decent, along with a soundtrack featuring Fear Factory and some lesser known bands, but the graphics seem a little blocky, almost N64-ish, and don't take advantage of the DC's graphics horsepower engine.

New gameplay elements that truly took the Gameboy Color to its limits stand out as well!  So much is introduced in Pokemon Gold and Silver that it stands out as not only one of the Best Pokemon games of all time, but also as one of the best GBC games of all time! As far as graphics and eye-candy goes, this is a much bigger step above Red/Yellow/Blue.  Smoother animations and much clearer visuals.  Not to mention that its VERY colorful and completely takes advantage of all the colors the GBC can use!  Also, in battle looks a lot better than in the previous versions. Animations look better and battles progress a whole lot faster! As far as gameplay is concerned, its hard to put Pokemon Gold/Silver down.  There is a new feature introduced in this game that once again shows that the GBC is more than we think it is.  The internal clock has made the gameplay so much more interesting.  The game actually changes between day and night and it changes based on how YOU set it up!  Not only that but pokemon only come out at a certain time of the day.  Some come out in the early morning and others come out at night! Catching Pokemon hasn't changed much from Red/Yellow/Blue. The difference is that you now have several different kinds of pokeballs.  You've got Heavy Balls to capture Heavy Pokemon, Level Balls that catch pokemon at rather low levels, Marine Balls for catching water pokemon and the list goes on. The other interesting tidbit is perhaps the Pokegear that is introduced and the Cell Phone feature.  The Pokegear makes it so you can carry more than just 20 items like before. You've got a seperate pouch for Balls, Key Items, TMs and HMs and just your normal healing items and such. The Cell Phone feature is nice and probably one of the best additions to the game!  After you challenge some trainers you can ask them for their number. When you have their number they'll call you and do a few things. Some wlll ask for a rematch, some will tell you of Pokemon Swarms, some will give you an items. Most of the time, however, trainers will call to tell you stupid things, such as the status of their pokemon or how they beat other trainers. Of course the whole story is to become a Pokemon Master.  You get to explore a new world of Johto but in the end you'll end up having a nostalgic time in Kanto (the setting of Red/Yellow/Blue games) but in a different sense that once you defeat the elite four, you'll have to start a new journey and ultimately you'll end up fighting the toughest trainer in the game (the hero from the Red/Yellow/Blue Games). The small gripes with the game.  Well, for starters the Random Encounter rate is high at times which is rather annoying.  Second, some trainers are just imopossible to dodge. In fact on most routes you'll have to fight all the trainers and it isn't by choice. You fight them because you HAVE to. The music is great! In Johto at least.  In Kanto the remix music of the Red/Yellow/Blue versions is terrible.  Not to mention that when you get to Kanto, all the Pokemon are of low levels and are actually the exact same level they are in Red/Yellow/Blue. The game is worth the buy though.  This is one of thsoe addicting games that you'll find yourself coming back to over and over again and the best Pokemon game of them all!

It was sort of inevitable that their attention would move on to Greece, one of our founding civiliations. Zeus follows in its predecessors footsteps, making it relatively simple to pick up on the basic idea. You plant your crops, build your industries, set up trade and shops and tax collectors. Add in some basic services - home maintenance, water, infirmaries. They've got, of course, Greek-themed things to build. The theater is a big draw, as are the gymnasiums and schools of philosophy. It's religion, though, where this game differs from the others. Instead of trying to balance your way through keeping all the gods happy, in most missions you are working towards bringing in a hero, or pleasing a certain god. And these gods are very personal! The first mission, for example, involves a hydra. You don't build up warriors to kill it - you biuld a temple to the hero Hercules, and once you make the town alluring enough, he appears and roams around, spouting heroisms. He goes and kills the Hydra for you, and all is well. The game has a series of tutorials for those who haven't played this type of sim before, but for those experienced in the others, diving into the first \"beginner\" mission isn't a walk in the park. Unlike some other games where the first missions boringly walk you through the same old crop maintenance, this starts you full bore into the game, with a very wide selection of buildings you can use and things to do. It gets more challenging from there. There are also various open play options, if you just want to create your own military adventure or build a city that stretches from coast to coast. In all, the game is not a huge change from its predecessors, but it's still quite fun!</td><td>Great game with a keen sense of humor</td><td>977184000</td><td>1</td><td>326</td><td>1517</td><td>17</td><td>4.653374233128834</td><td>19.176470588235293</td><td>0.06865546</td><td>862</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>16144</td><td>5.0</td><td>0</td><td>true</td><td>11 14, 2001</td><td>B00004TJCL</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Let me first start by saying I was once quite against first-person-shooters. Games that encouraged you to run mindlessly around, shooting other people, didn't seem to have much value. That was until I played CounterStrike, though. I've always been a HUGE fan of strategy. Games that encouraged you to think, to plan ahead and to execute the plan as a team, really thrilled me. When I saw my first games of Counterstrike, it was like watching Band of Brothers on HBO. One unit worked together to the left, while another coordinated on the right. Each followed the plan closely to capture the flag. Yes, you knocked out the enemy. But it was in the persuit of a goal, to achieve an objective. It was AMAZINGLY fun! Some people might object that it's bloody, that it promotes people killing people. If you're going to worry about games that have winners and losers, then any game of tag, or dodge-ball or 'cowboys and indians' is going to fall victim. Here, people who are shot respawn so they can regroup with their team. The victory goes to the smartest team with the best plan - the team that works well together and defends each other. I don't know of a better objective for a game. Best of all, being a net game, this can easily be played as a family. Your uncle in Texas, your aunt in Mississippi, and your cousin in California can join into the game, all playing vital roles regardless of their location, age, sex, color, or anything else. I highly recommend this as a game for anyone over 12, and I'd encourage you to get a few copies to give to other friends and family members.

The developers have worked hard to make a gorgeous environment that truly supports great team players and tacticians. First, gameplay in general is just beautiful. Whether you're playing single or multiplayer, you can really appreciate the crisp graphics, the ability to roam in and out of buildings. The weapon selection and diversity is great. All those addicted to HALO know how much fun vehicles are. Tribes 2 gives you a few to choose from - a Scout ATV, a tank with a spot for a gunner, and even an APC that holds 6! Multiplayer is where the game really shines though. The game is simply wonderful for teams to work together to achieve an objective. There are games running all the time on the net, and anybody that has trained up on their home system will have no trouble slipping into one of the on line games and getting into the swing of things. I've had people of all ages and backgrounds playing on my computer, and once they've gotten themselves familiar with the controls in the training, they've gone on line and had a blast! I've read some reviews that say the game is too hard in multiplayer mode. I really haven't found that at all. True, you shouldn't just leap into multiplayer without first learning how the game works. That's true for any game you buy, though. If you go through the training and single player missions, though, it's very easy to learn the ropes and to graduate into team play rather quickly.

Simply put, the PS2 is the best 128 bit system ever created, featuring a gigantic library of games, many of which set the standard for gaming today and in the future.  Where else can you play the incredibly fun Guitar Hero?  Or find unique games like Shadow of the Colossus and Ico?  Or the platforming excellence of the Jak and Daxter series and Ratchet & Clank series?  There's a plethora of RPG's for the RPG nuts, and the list of sports and racing games are second to none.  The original XBox has always topped the PS2 in terms of graphics and online capabilities, and the first party support isn't as quality laden as Nintendo's on the Gamecube, but the PS2 is still the simplest console to operate and trouble shoot, and even though it's life span is dwindling down now, it's still the best system available right now (yes, it even tops the XBox 360, for now that is) and there's still some great games to come for the system, particularly the highly anticipated sequels to God of War and Guitar Hero, as well as exclusive titles like Okami and God's Hand.

Now, Dark Mirror has been ported to the PS2, but sadly, the fun action game from last year has been stripped down, and much of what made the game so fun the first time around has been lost in translation.  What really made the game so fun on the PSP, namely the online multiplayer content, has been completely removed on the PS2.  This is just unacceptable to say the least, considering that in itself was what made the game worth picking up the first time around.  Besides this noticable, glaring flaw, the rest of Dark Mirror isn't all bad despite the short length of the overall campaign.  The game looks great on the PS2, the controls are tighter using the Dual Shock controler than on the PSP's face buttons, and the action is highly enjoyable.  Though there's little reason to go back to Dark Mirror once you finish it, there's still enough here to warrant a look at the very least, but considering the best feature of the game has been removed and the game doesn't have a budget price, Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror is better off left on the shelf.</td><td>Disappointing</td><td>1190505600</td><td>1</td><td>229</td><td>1026</td><td>8</td><td>4.4803493449781655</td><td>28.625</td><td>0.0060669193</td><td>805</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>16239</td><td>5.0</td><td>24</td><td>false</td><td>03 16, 2003</td><td>B00004TNDY</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>The PS2 Multitap lets four players play any PS2 game.

The game that shares Yoshi's name is one of those puzzle games, but it's actually executed pretty well, and knowing Nintendo, you would expect that. Like Tetris, Yoshi has a single-player mode and a 2-Player versus mode. Both make for incredibly addicting experiences! You can stack up 2 of the signature Mario enemies of the same type (Goomba, Boo, Piranha Plant, and Blooper) to make them disappear, OR for a much more amusing situation, you could stack up the enemies atop the bottom half of an egg, and place the upper half on top of it all. Suddenly, BOOM, the enemies have been CRAMMED into an egg! As for the versus mode, you know what to expect when it comes to a puzzle game containing this feature. Make as much enemy sandwiches as possible, causing the other player to be given a certain obstacle, and so on. So, if you have a puzzle itch to scratch, Yoshi is right up your alley.

After defeating Clockwerk in the first game they were obtained illegally and the gang must get them back to destroy them. Along the way Carmelita Fox is still trying to capture them while a few new faces show up. The game is the same at the core, but everything around that has completely changed. This really feels like a whole new game. For starters you will notice there are no individual levels anymore. The game is more sandbox with various missions you can take on when you want. You can play as all three characters this time around, and each one has their own specific missions. Each character feels different, Murray is a huge lumbering hippo who can't use stealth and instead whacks away enemies in just a couple of hits. Bentley is equipped with a sleeping dart crossbow and has various gadgets he can use to get around. In fact, they all have gadgets and abilities you can purchase with those coins that were useless in the first game. 100 no longer gives you a life because that whole system is gone. Instead you now have a life bar and when you die you restart at the last checkpoint. This games playing a whole lot easier and relieves a lot of the frustrations from the first game. Additionally, the interior areas of the game are mission specific so you won't be going back. I honestly preferred the individual levels because navigating these hub worlds can be a pain. Getting to certain places requires climbing around certain areas to get to. Some areas are a real pain and you have to figure out how to get there. Just to get to a main mission, this is pretty lame. I don't want to spend 5 minutes climbing around a confusing level just to start a mission. It doesn't help that enemies respawn all the time when you kill them and they are everywhere. It gets really frustrating when you just want to get to a mission and you have to keep killing the same enemies all the time. Thankfully some abilities like smoke screen, shock cane, and the paraglider help Sly get around easier, but the other two have to find their way completely via the ground which means long round about ways to get to a mission marker. When you start a mission you will notice they are varied and pretty fun. Bentley has a new hacking mini-game that is a dual stick shooter, Murray punches things a lot, and Sly has a new pickpocketing ability which he can use to get coins and loot from guards to sell for abilities and to get those keys. A lot of the gauntlet style levels are really fun and require quick reflexes. There are 8 episodes and the game is just as tough as the last one. Boss fights now have meters and don't go down in a few hits anymore. You have to slowly chip away their health to beat them and it requires patience. Overall, the game feels mostly the same with missions just varying from hacking mini-games, beat this or that up, or pickpocket X amount of keys. It starts to feel old towards the end, plus the navigation of hub worlds will just drive you nuts after a while. There are still clue bottles and vaults to be found, but they just have extra abilities in them and really aren't worth searching for. The clue bottles will take over an hour to find in each level because the hubs are so difficult to navigate. There are 30 in each hub, but good luck finding them all without throwing the controller. Besides this there are no extras in the game like the last one which is disappointing. Despite all this, I think the large open hubs are what hurt the game the most because of how annoying they are to navigate. The mission variety is really nice, but by the end they just repeat themselves. The graphics are upgraded greatly with better physics, better looking textures, and higher resolution models. The controls are a little tighter and the camera was fixed a little, but it can still get stuck or lost some times. Overall, Sly 2 is an excellent game, but just feels too similar to the last game. With the whole sandbox idea I feel they are hard to navigate and get in the way of the getting around to different missions.</td><td>A worthy sequel</td><td>1362528000</td><td>0</td><td>812</td><td>3625</td><td>42</td><td>4.464285714285714</td><td>19.333333333333332</td><td>0.040634856</td><td>471</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>16419</td><td>5.0</td><td>25</td><td>false</td><td>06 18, 2001</td><td>B00004TSX4</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Remember all those things recent games were supposed to offer?

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>Ah, now here is a Mario story worth retelling! The year 2001 was more-or-less dominated by the Nintendo Gamecube and Game Boy Advance, but the classic N64 still had a few tricks up its sleeve; any regular person would be quick to think that giving Mario a paper aesthetic would seem pretty silly, but Paper Mario proved that it could work...mainly because the visuals weren't the entire point of the game. While the Paper Mario name has lately been tainted by games that hardly ever relate/fail miserably in comparison to the trio of Paper Marios of last decade, there was once a time where it was okay to give the Mario franchise an RPG and all the creative freedom it needed to accomplish sheer greatness. Easily one of the best things that make up Paper Mario is its charming characterization. Just about everybody Mario encounters has a distinct personality, and they can make for either some interesting insights into the location at hand or a chuckleworthy line. Many of the characters are more than welcome to have some screen time, as this game would be their only appearance in the franchise. I'll never forget the Koopa Bros., who are basically Bowser minion versions of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Rosie the self-absorbed flower, or the adorable little Star Kid that is Twink! Even characters you know and love in the Mario universe already have been substantially suited to their roles in this game; Bowser gets badass and lifts up the entirety of Peach's Castle with his own, but sports an egotistical brutish persona, and while Peach is held captive up there, she and Twink are competent enough to sneak around to give Mario information on where to go next on his journey to bring back the Seven Star Spirits. And what does Mario do on his adventure to Bowser's Castle? He befriends villages of Goombas and Koopas, discovers the lost ruins of a desert being scoured by archaeologists, dives into a toy box, and even acts upon a murder mystery (Granted, it inevitably turns out the victim's alive, but for a game targeted towards all ages, just the fact they played it out like a murder mystery for a significant amount of time certainly takes balls to do). This may be the Mushroom Kingdom, but this is unlike anything Mario's been doing prior (except for Super Mario RPG of course). I'm probably beating a dead horse at this point, but I truly adore Paper Mario's use of substance and depth in its settings and characters. The Mario world feels that much more alive and imaginative in my eyes! The use of genuinely funny jokes in many instances of the game also serves this sparked sense of imagination very well, and the fact that the balanced-out humor and drama dynamics have since played an even bigger part of the atmosphere in the game's sequels was the kind of Godsend I never knew I wanted until then! As much as I like talking about atmosphere, however, I should also give Paper Mario credit for the parts that make up the actual functionality of the game. When you aren't busy fighting off varied types of enemies to gain Star Points, you're wandering around a field, town, village, or wherever else to get to your destination where you face off against a boss. Or so that's the rundown anyway. There is much more to it than just walking place to place; Paper Mario actually provides plenty of puzzle-solving in the overworld, and it fits the game pretty neatly I may add. The puzzles aren't too hard, yet they can still tease your brain a bit, as they make interesting and clever uses of Mario's abilities and his partners he meets along the way. Even then, should you get stumped, you could have your pally, Goombario, provide you with a usually helpful hint, or you could go over to Merlon at Toad Town and pay him a small sum of coins to tell you what you're supposed to do. The puzzles are satisfying, as are the lands that they reside in. And now for the battle mechanics! Whenever Mario encounters a baddie in the overworld, the game makes no hesitation to switch over to a battlefield setting so Mario and co. can fight back! The turn-based battle system the game embraces is somewhat like that of a traditional RPG, except things get fairly active when button commands are applied to keep the action flowing, such as when the player performs an attack at its maximum power, or when he/she has to dodge enemy fire to take less damage. The formula is a very flexible one, really; you must pay careful attention to the enemy types (one could be wearing spikes on its head, for example), see which partner of yours could impact the fight most, and which badges you have equipped for special moves. It's simple to get into, but ultimately a pleasure to master, especially when you gain 100 Star Points to Level Up and earn more HP and FP, effectively becoming stronger. It's...really hard for me to knock this game down on anything, really. Though if I do have to nitpick, I suppose it could be that the music feels...How do I put it...? I understand that the Nintendo 64 uses a MIDI format for music on its hardware, but you really wouldn't think about that when listening to some of the more iconic soundtracks of the console. For Paper Mario, it feels more blatant that these are MIDIs when it comes down to the selected instrumentation, and it is kinda jarring as a result. Not to the extent of me being bothered with its sound design, though; on the contrary, I still do like plenty of the game's music, and the sound effects work well enough. Other than that...I frickin' LOVE this game! Heck, I love this series! The Paper Mario games are simply the best trio of Mario RPG (and in the third one's case, platform-RPG-hybrid) games the franchise could ever have. Not only is the visual style pleasing to the eye, but they're witty, fun, creative, hilarious, and one-of-a-kind games. If you have a Wii or Wii U, you owe it to yourself to at least pick this game up on the eShop and see what made this series so amazing! Or if you happen to still have a Nintendo 64 lying around, you could blow the dust off of it and spend well over a dozen hours with it by playing this masterpiece.</td><td>The birth of Mario's grandest RPG series</td><td>1460332800</td><td>0</td><td>1094</td><td>5027</td><td>44</td><td>4.595063985374772</td><td>24.863636363636363</td><td>0.11236896</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>16548</td><td>4.0</td><td>6</td><td>false</td><td>02 26, 2001</td><td>B00004U1R3</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>Anything with the name Mario on it tends to have the golden touch. Just look at Mario 64, one of the classics on the N64 and still an incredibly playable game. Super Smash Brothers was another Mario game that was amazingly fun. Mario Paper is more like an RPG/arcade combination. It lets Mario take on other characters to join his team, and rotate between them to choose his current companion. He picks up different weapons and items, each altering his combat techniques. Like Final Fantasy and other RPG games, it also gives you some degree of customization over Mario as he gains level in combat. You can increase his 'magic' (flower power) or his 'constition' (heart power). You can collect badges as you go, each giving you different strengths. You can manage which badge combinations you activate, giving you interesting pairings of power. Gameplay is much like any other N64 RPG. You go from town to town, killing bad guys as you go and talking to every friendly person that you meet. People give you clues about where to go and what to do. On the downside, for a RPG it's extremely linear - you can't go through X door until you talk to Y person and get your hands on Z object. You have to do things in a certain order even if logically that wouldn't be true. Also, the Peach character bugs me a lot.  She could try to resist when she's captured, but instead she sits and whines that SOMEONE has to come rescue her. No thought about doing anything for herself ... Fighting is both good and bad. The first fight is exceptionally annoying, because you get thrown into it with only one ability. Even if you do that the best that you can, you still get beaten and look like you've \"died\". This will probably be really frustrating to first time players, especially younger ones. In general though it works reasonably well. It's turn based, so slower players won't feel rushed in making their choices. It's pretty straightforward - the options are all laid out right in front of you. You have to learn which things work on which characters, and the complexity builds slowly as you go. Definitely a game we'll play through at this house, and one I'd buy for my gaming friends, but it's a shame they didn't put just a bit more effort into player-testing it before releasing it.</td><td>Great RPG fun for all ages, with a few quirks</td><td>983145600</td><td>1</td><td>409</td><td>1866</td><td>30</td><td>4.5623471882640585</td><td>13.633333333333333</td><td>0.099583335</td><td>862</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>16701</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 9, 2009</td><td>B00004U4R9</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Many people believe the third time is officially the charm.  When a game finally gets everything right as far as gameplay, graphics and music go and delivers the ultimate experience. Other times game developers disregard the things that were most enjoyable the first couple times to put more emphasis on other areas of the game (in this case, the fantastic bonus stages). Why so many people believe Year of the Dragon is the ultimate Spyro game is a total mystery to me. I believe something went wrong with the level design because several of the stages are flat out boring. Maybe Insomniac was under the impression during the creation of this game \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" or maybe people are confusing the fact you have a bunch of playable characters besides Spyro as something of an additional bonus to enhance the gameplay, but I have to disagree strongly.  These extra playable characters definitely aren't enough to put this game over the top I'm afraid.  Nice additions perhaps, but nothing spectacular. No, it's not an example of me getting tired of Spyro either. I've played the first two Spyro games quite a lot. I must have completed the first one at least 20 times, and Ripto's Rage 10 times. I'd play through them again right now if I could. There were some minor flaws with the first two games, but they honestly didn't mean anything to me. Certainly nothing to distract from the incredible gameplay and graphics that were so revolutionary in the development of 3D gaming at the time. I now feel a bit guilty for complaining that the very end of Zephyr seems boring to me because comparing that little area near the end of Zephyr to many of the areas in THIS game... let's just say, I had *nothing* to complain about. To me, the most exciting kind of 3D platformers are the ones that are positively LOADED with tons of little things to collect such as what the first two Spyro games delievered. You know, things like colorful gems scattered around the stages, a nice variety of enemies to take out, little things such as trees and grass included into most areas of every stage with special care and consideration for detail.  Adding these minor details actually make the graphics and gameplay better because they leave a lasting impression. Year of the Dragon feels flat in comparison. To say I'm a little disappointed would be an understatement. I'm *very* disappointed. After all the hype that Spyro's third installment is supposed to be the *ultimate* Spyro adventure by the majority of the gaming community, I was expecting to be blown away completely by this one. I was expecting this game to blow away the previous two by leaps and bounds. Instead, many of the stages are quite ordinary and bland in Spyro 3, and to be totally honest, many of them feel exactly the same, or have that \"been there, done that\" feeling.  Year of the Dragon is quite similar to Ripto's Rage as far as atmosphere goes, but feels inferior most of the time for reasons that could have been avoided had Insomniac worked harder on making the levels better.  Insomniac instead gave us a game that does nothing truly noteworthy to separate itself from Ripto's Rage. It's disappointing. Rushing through large areas of empty land *just* to finally come across a few scattered gems here and there, or enemies spaced out in such a way that it takes a while to arrive to them... these are the kind of things I dislike about most 3D games. Spyro the Dragon and Ripto's Rage avoided most of these boring problems since both of those games did just about everything right. In these two games, traveling your way through the many stages was always exciting because there was a ton of things to collect or destroy along the way (with detailed areas around every corner).  Not to mention when you entered a level covered with water or ice in the previous two Spyro adventures, it actually FELT like a water or ice stage. If it takes me several seconds just to ARRIVE to something while playing Year of the Dragon, that tells me the gameplay is a bit on the boring side. Year of the Dragon falls victim to this I'm afraid, on more occasions than I was hoping for. Many times you will run up and down hills, platforms, and other areas and come across *nothing* the entire time. This is a problem to me because this kind of thing didn't happen very often in the first two games.  There was always something to do in the first two games no matter WHERE you turned. When the levels felt boring in the beginning of Year of the Dragon, I just thought the game was leading me gradually to more impressive levels. But once arriving to world 3 and STILL feeling bored and disappointed, I realized the level design was just below typical Spyro standards this time around.  Not to mention all the home worlds are so ordinary they become boring almost instantly. Do I still like this game more than most video games I've played? Absolutely. It's STILL Spyro, you're STILL going around collecting gems and dragons, you're STILL having fun controlling Spyro's movements and taking advantage of his fun abilities, but I don't know... I get the feeling Insomniac didn't put as much care into this one that they did with the first two games (which are both classics in my opinion). The game DOES have a few interesting stages on the same level as the ones in the previous two Spyro games but there's a bunch of average ones along the way. Besides Insomniac not bothering to make the levels impressive or particularly fun, there's a couple other problems. The object is to go around rescuing baby dragons (many of which require the player to attempt something harder than usual in order to achieve).  However you get the feeling you're just repeating what's already been done in the very first Spyro game when, if you recall, the dragons would actually talk to you after you've freed them and say funny things. The dragons in this game are babies and they don't talk, and it's not nearly as much fun freeing dragons this time around. This isn't a BIG complaint, but a mild disappointment and a nagging feeling that all I'm doing is the same thing I've done before, but much better the first time. The baby dragons ARE cute, and they sometimes do funny things after they've been freed such as spin around, scratch behind their ears, and basically do things puppies and kittens do. If you're an animal lover like me, you'll fall in love with the way the baby dragons act. It's adorable and a nice touch. I don't know if most people noticed, but most of the bonus games consist of constant shooting.  Shooting, shooting, and well, MORE shooting.  One bonus level even morphs the gameplay into a first person shooter similar to Quake as you go around eliminating enemies. Of course this particular one gets quite repetitive after you've blown through a few rooms, and it's not very exciting because it's overlong, but some of the shooting action you come across in the game is quite good (such as blasting away that machine shark in that one game- I love this one). Plentiful shooting throughout Year of the Dragon such as shooting fireballs, cannons, and other things that first appeared in Ripto's Rage, but usually they are pretty memorable so I won't complain about this. Some of the bonus stages are quite difficult too, such as the boxing one. Just like real boxing- when you throw a punch, your opponent either immediately throws a punch of his own or blocks to defend himself. This makes these boxing games incredibly hard, and perhaps the hardest thing you will discover in the first three Spyro games from the Playstation's first console... but at least it's *fun*. The skateboarding bonus games are AWESOME. They appear more than once throughout the game, and they deliver a lot of excitement. I'm surprised how much detail went into the skateboarding games as far as the approach you take with the skateboard itself. Not *quite* at the level of detail that Tony Hawk provides or anything, but enough tricks to make skateboarding fun and something you wouldn't mind mastering with time and patience. The biggest highlight of the game easily. Another highlight are the special characters you play as- One of them is a kangaroo, probably the best one since he jumps high and has a kick move that's devastating. You have another playable character that's a beastly creature and he has a big club going around pounding things. It's fun, but he moves slow and he's not particularly interesting. There's some kind of monkey that shoots with his little outer space-looking gun. This is somewhat fun, but like I said above, the game REALLY goes too far with the constant shooting you'll be doing throughout the game. The Sparx games are fun because the gameplay turns into old school Gradius gameplay for each of his levels. It's an interesting change of direction (and not NEARLY as frustrating as trying to master Gradius, thankfully). I HATE playing as the bird though. He flies awkwardly, he's very very boring to play as, and his stages and challenges are just uninteresting to me. To be completely honest though, I'd rather play as Spyro the entire time if given the choice, but these characters are decent enough overall. The boss fight at the very end of the game is fun, but the boss is WAY too similar to Ripto with the whole arena showdown battle, and compared to that epic battle this one is over much sooner, and not nearly as memorable. Boss fights overall are a notch up as far as difficulty goes however. Most of the music in the game is good but nothing compares to the original Spyro (including Ripto's Rage). Some of the voice acting is questionable. For whatever reason Moneybags doesn't sound nearly as conniving as he does in Ripto's Rage. His voice definitely sounds different. Whoever thought it was a good idea for Sparx to talk needs a spanking, enough said. Overall this game is NOT a classic which is unfortunate because Insomniac nailed the first two games right on the head and made two classic (and original) platformers. Year of the Dragon misses the mark and unfortunately can't be put on the same brilliant scale. Why so many people claim Year of the Dragon is the best in the series is a mystery to me because even though the levels are longer, they clearly aren't better or more fun.  But Year of the Dragon does succeed in the bonus games above everything else.</td><td>a surprising disappointment</td><td>1252454400</td><td>0</td><td>1834</td><td>8533</td><td>97</td><td>4.652671755725191</td><td>18.90721649484536</td><td>0.06628977</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A3W4D8XOGLWUN5</td><td>16760</td><td>4.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>12 20, 2002</td><td>B00004U1QY</td><td>Michael Kerner</td><td>When Nintendo stopped making games for their Nintendo 64, many people seemed to balme it on the Playstation 2.

The game also features amazing details of games including skilled ring games, and tournaments and hidden courses with zany Mario themes.

Gameplay brings back the addictive qualities of pong and other such games - try to put spin and lob on the ball to sneak past your opponents. You can play with up to four players, using the computer as substitutes for humans if you wish. There are different court types to add complexity to gameplay. There are also a series of fun games where you have to get the most rings, or use special items, or even play on a moving base. There are also competitions where you work your way progressively through your opponents until you emerge the victor.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev)</td><td>I'm sure many of you reading this know about the strange history Conker the Squirrel has had himself wrapped up in before claiming the spotlight with Bad Fur Day, but in case if you don't, here's what happened: This game started life as a kid-friendly platformer named \"Conker's Quest\" (which got renamed into \"Twelve Tales: Conker 64\"), but with the collectathon 3D platformer genre growing increasingly (with Rare's own Banjo Kazooie adding fuel to the fire no less) and how some critics mocked the child-friendly approach of it, the folks at Rare decided to crank it all up to THE EXTREME, and in 2001, this was the result of the new mindset. Conker's Bad Fur Day is anything BUT your ordinary 3D mascot platformer; there will be blood and gore, cursing up the wazoo, movie parodies, and sexual antics aplenty! This is a primary example of a game that does what it can to stand out from the rest of the crowd, but fortunately, there is indeed wit behind it all (even if the surface is full of total nonsense). It's basically the video game equivalent of South Park before the show decided to directly enter the industry with The Stick of Truth. And to think it was developed by RARE and published by NINTENDO no less! The presentation of it all is something to behold. Right off the bat, Conker gets completely drunk and meets an equally boozed-up scarecrow who struggles to tell him an important aspect of the game, fights a giant opera-singing monster made up of crap, gets turned into a bat to throw civilians into a wooden grinder, fetches a beehive that doubles as a machine gun turret, drunkenly pees on rock people at a strip club for such, etc! Nowhere else can you find the kind of absurd adventures that this foul-mouthed squirrel embarks upon, and the characters and their dialogue exchanges are the best kind of raunchy comedy you could find. For example, there's something truly hilarious about a paint pot and brush verbally trashing a gay pitchfork's attempt at kicking Conker's ass. While those aspects of the game are arguably some of the best moments of gaming out there, the gameplay itself isn't as remarkable. Conker is able to run, jump, and fly with his tail, sure, but nothing feels anywhere as grand as in, say, the Banjo Kazooie games; the platforming challenges are rather small and confined, and there are several times where the game would end up coming off as more of a point and click where I happen to control a character instead of a cursor. While that may not sound so bad, there will be some times where Conker would have to fetch several objects for someone or something, and there would be too much of those objects to collect; despite the Great Mighty Poo being one of the all-time greatest bosses, the process of getting to meet him was tedious since you had to fetch him EVERY corn tooth for him to use as teeth. The \"context-sensitive\" actions that Conker can do by pressing B make things interesting, but it's more situational than grabbing a power-up in another game. Some actions can be pretty fun to use or add to the game's comedic value (Pressing B in the Matrix parody level causes Conker to jump in slow motion), while others can be frustrating through means of a delay in Conker's animations (Do not press B as soon as a bat flies towards Conker! He won't take out his flamethrower in time!). Really, the gameplay and control are generally rather flawed, but they don't hamper the experience to a point where it ruins the game. Cutscenes and worlds tend to feel like rewards for your efforts in overcoming certain challenges the game throws at you, and in that regard, the game is definitely a constantly rewarding experience. I just wish the play mechanics were stronger than they were in actuality. With all that's said and done, however, Conker's Bad Fur Day is a game that I believe is worth checking out if just for the unique comically raunchy performances alone, with the game itself doing okay enough to bridge the funniness together. That is, if you DON'T BUY THE NINTENDO 64 CARTRIDGE!! $85+ for only this game is simply CRIMINAL. Just get a copy of Rare Replay for the Xbox One instead.

Were they determined to come up with something extreme possibly because they feared people would think they're venturing too far into children's game territory?  Unfortunately they would inevitably end up mostly making children's games and try to cover it up by describing themsevles as a family-oriented company when the Wii was released, but for this one point in time Nintendo and Rare didn't hold anything back.  Also yeah, Rare!  It turns out the same company responsible for the Donkey Kong Country series had a naughty/edgy side too, haha. Wow I should have taken those old reviews for Conker's Bad Fur Day more seriously 10-12 years ago.  I saw a cute fuzzy little squirrel in the pictures and automatically assumed this was a game for kids and that the vulgar nature was an exaggeration.  No, it's all true! This game is *awesome*.  But it's NOT for kids!  I'm totally not kidding what I'm about to say- this game says the \"sh\" word and disguises the king of ALL swear words in ways that almost reveal it!  To top it off, there's blood that often pours and gushes with disturbing noticeable puddles whenever you kill enemies with guns or frying pans and there's even decapitations (eat your heart out Mortal Kombat!)  But this game goes a step further.  I guess the makers *really* wanted to come out with something ridiculously intense, likely a message sent to Sony that Nintendo can hang with the big boys too.  Brace yourself- you can also urinate on enemies while controlling your drunken squirrel main character (Conker) who wobbles back and forth struggling to stand up confidently proving he's not intended for children, and you even fight a gigantic mound of operatic/poetic singing poop by throwing toilet paper in its mouth!  They really play up the poop theme throughout a good chunk of the first half with balls and rivers of the gooey brown stuff everywhere (diarrhea in particular).  Ewww!  Also throwing up, farting sound effects, etc.  LOTS of it! But there's a reason I'm giving this game 5 stars and it's not just the shock value either.  It's the fact that this orange little squirrel character has a LOT of personality. He's the type of character many of us grown men can relate to.  He likes naked women and we often see displays of breasts presented in outrageous ways that stand out lusciously (like that sunflower woman for example!) and Conker just LOVES money.  Collecting money is even a theme for this game, and the fact that the talking money *itself* is capable of insulting Conker by using cuss words (\"You greedy b******\") is hilarious and even gives the game an overly goofy Earthworm Jim quality.  I also can't help but feel sadness for how dire the look on Conker's face becomes whenever he stumbles into a really bad situation (which is often hence the \"bad fur day\").  He's so adorable and yet, due to the wonderful animations and lively facial expressions, you can't help but feel sorry for him. It's not just Conker with all this personality being shown.  ALL the characters manage to be highly enjoyable.  The mound of poop, the mob boss guy, the talking broken pitchfork, the cow with the squirts, Conker's valley girl-like girlfriend, the adorable talking hand puppet at the end with such an innocent/adorable voice... just about everybody has their own personality in this game so no character is weak.  The storyline is very easy to follow and intended for adults given all the swearing and sexual situations, and the emphasis on being creative is top priority.  Let me explain the creativity aspect- In addition to fighting a huge fecal spitting ball of poop deep within a cave and drunkenly peeing on the bad guys, the game takes it's cue from the Earthworm Jim formula by assuring every new area of exploration offers a radically different obstacle that, believe it or not, actually serves as a storyline advancement.  All these outrageous events actually tie together.  You will find yourself riding bulls and plowing the fecal matter out of female cows, battling overweight cavemen, riding on hover boards to collect money, retrieving beehives to help a lonely sad bee desperate for help, turning into a bat and dropping critters into a grinder, shooting moaning zombie squirrels inside a graveyard, nervously carrying dangerous bombs to the next destination, helping a pitchfork stab bales of hay, exploring a haunted house for keys and more zombie shooting fun, entering a VERY chaotic war scene later on (which is when the games difficulty boosts significantly), carefully figuring your way through red explosive laser beams and oh... that brings me to the next point. The second half of this game is mainly a succession of popular movie or video game references such as the Clockwork Orange, the Terminator, Saving Private Ryan, Metal Gear Solid, Medal of Honor, Alien, Matrix-style slow motion effects (not a fan of this one to be honest even though the parody is spot-on, but that's probably because I've never been a fan of the movie) and probably several more I never caught.  This game has it all and more.  You can NOT get bored with a game like Conker's Bad Fur Day.  You'd never guess by the cutscene in the very beginning when Conker's sitting around in a grumpy mood about to explain the day he went through just had BAD it really was! Challenge-wise this game can be downright insanely difficult.  This is actually due to the level of goofiness reaching a point that it occasionally interferes with understanding the objectives at hand.  More than occasionally- at least half of the time.  Nothing's obvious with a game like this.  If you've ever played Earthworm Jim you'll know what to expect, but of course Earthworm Jim never set out to be vulgar and inappropriate which is why this is clearly not a kids game whereas Earthworm Jim is allowed to pass for one (though believe it or not I actually remember a time when Earthworm Jim was considered questionable for the younger crowd- never could figure out why).  Also the play control is often strange and you'll be spending time figuring out how to move certain objects such as army tanks later on in order to line up ideal necessary shots, and several other things throughout the game. Every character has a cute, almost British-like voice too, which is another element of deception taking place here.  Forget everything I said about the Nintendo 64 being inferior to the Playstation One.  Had I played Conker's Bad Fur Day as my first N64 choice I'd probably have had a different reaction.

Using the Resident Evil formula of pre-rendered backgrounds with 3-D animated characters, Evil Dead suffers from poor polygon designs, clunky controls, and the same \"find the key to open the door\" type gameplay we've seen in games like the Resident Evil series and Alone in the Dark.  Evil Dead star Bruce Campbell lends his voice to Ash and breathes some life into this otherwise dismal game, but the terrible control layout and configuration really bring this game down.

I admit it, I was a HUGE addict of the original Gauntlet, with the Green Archer Needs Food Badly. When Gauntlet came out for the Nintendo, I bought it immediately and played it non stop for hours and hours. I came across G:DL when it was first released and without examining the box much at all, it was MINE. Let me tell you, I was NOT disappointed! This is the first game we played with more than two people on our Playstation 2 - we bought the MultiTap explicitly for this game. It's a blast! And the improvements are astounding. First off, you get up to eight main characters. I have always loved the archer, but I play the others at times too. As you move them up levels, their appearance changes, they get cool familiars, their spells get more powerful, they learn new abilities, they get to heal, and much more. The levels are both familiar and fascinating. Just wait until you get into the Jester's world! The Escher-like levels are phenomonally fun. Someone really had a good mastery of space to develop those worlds. The other graphics are equally as interesting. The music and monsters all fit well with the worlds. It's not just hack and slash. There are a lot of puzzles, a lot of what-do-you-use-keys-on, a lot of mazes and memory and combinations involved. There are even hidden characters, additional SECRET characters and other hidden things that it's taken a ton of replaying to get a walkthrough written. The same is completely replayable and is a perfect friends-for-the-afternoon kind of game.

More than a standard action puzzle game, Monkey Island glows with a keen sense of humor and a nefarious mind for tricky combinations. Your hero, Guybrush Threepwood, is back again - this time as a married pirate with a governer-wife. You roam around the islands, finding yourself a pirate crew, fighting duels and figuring out the various riddles that challenge you.  The dialogue is great. They throw in references to everything under the sun, from 'Zillionaire, Mansion and a Yacht' jokes about Bugs Bunny to sly comments about the OJ Simpson trial. There's something for every age group in here. I was very disappointed that they included a walkthrough *with* the software - I'm quite sure that many, many people will use the walkthrough without trying to figure out the puzzles on their own. Yes, they can be tricky sometimes, but the whole point of the game is to get that \"Aha!!\" moment when you get the right combination to work. Using the walkthrough skips tons of fun dialogue and results that only occur when you trial-and-error your way through. throughout. Other downsides include its tendency to crash (save OFTEN) and the confusing controls for movement. The graphics are great, though, and there is no way I could resist a game this witty.

It's not a bad adapter and it serves it's purpose pretty well, but when I watch TV on some channels the picture is grainy while on some others it is crisp and clear.  Not to mention when I watch a DVD movie (on my DVD player, not my PS2) the picture is noticibly either too bright or too dark depending on what film I'm watching (especially whenever I want to watch Minority Report, I'm squinting to see one minute than blocking my eyes from the brightness the next), but all this can be corrected by just unplugging the adapter cord and plugging in whichever cord (for TV, DVD, or otherwise) whenever your PS2 isn't in use.

There are few that really grab a tight hold of me ... but this was definitely one. As soon as it came out, I bought one copy for me and another as a present for a relative. That night I was up until 5am playing my couple - a criminal and a psychic - and building them up in career. Blearily I trudged to bed, dreaming of my Sims. The next night I promised myself I'd show a little more self control. I created a musician sim - in a fit of amusement I chose Britney Spears - and a partner in a Robin Hood outfit. She started playing on her electric guitar, and the Sim-friends that came by booed their fool heads off. A few hours later, she was ripping amazing riffs on her tiny instrument, and the Sim-buddies were now dancing around the living room. It was amazing. The wealth of new outfits for your sims, and objects to buy them, is just fantastic. Pets. Giant lights. Interesting, pretty doodads. The gorgeous new 60s windows and wallpaper, plus the gothic candelabras, arrow-slit windows, and even a robot make this an incredible enhancement. They've got fun jobs available, too. Want to be a Shooting Star in musical fame and glory? How about a slacker (think golf caddy) or hacker, or psychic or more? They're all there, each with their own outfits and career ladders. But wait, it even gets better. You can have MULTIPLE NEIGHBORHOODS. Now, since a given Sim family often needs 15 or more friends to get to the higher levels, the original game was pretty much one-person-only. You couldn't have multiple people use your computer, because there were a limited number of house lots to go around. The houses were simply needed for the Sim-Pals to live in (in groups of 8 of course). With the new system, each person who wants to play can have their very own neighborhood, where they grow and live to their heart's content. Sure, there are still a few bugs. Probably the most glaring one is the annoying lack of pathfinding ability. My psychic lost her job when she'd already gotten to Medium status because she was trapped in the bathroom. The maid and an unruly guest blocked both entrances, and I didn't blast a hole in the wall fast enough. In another scenario, a guest came into my kitchen, faced the fall, and refused to move. She in fact fell asleep against the wall. Once again, I had to make a hole in my house for her to escape. Pathfinding aside, though, the game is enormously addictive and I haven't been to bed before 3am since it has entered the house. The person to whom I gave it as a gift is experiencing the exact same problem. Sure, you can argue, is a high-school-band-teacher *really* a step up from being a lounge singer? By the time you're a Rock Star, with a huge pool and a bar in your back yard, you don't really care.

Offering up some of the best storytelling, characters and battle system the JRPG genre had ever seen.  It was fun, emotionally moving and incredibly original.  With such a game it was only a matter of time before a second game followed.  And while I'd love to tell you it's just as good as the first, it's hard for me to do so.  It's a great game but not quite as fantastic as that first one. A word of caution before moving on.  I first played Grandia II on the Playstation 2 when it was ported to that system.  And while I enjoyed that version a great deal, I'd implore anyone out there to play the original Dreamcast version over that one any day of the week.  We'll get to why, but first let's talk about the actual game. Ryudo is a member of the Geoblade's.  A mercenary group that will take odd jobs to make money.  In the village of Carbo he takes on the tasks of escorting Elena.  A priestess for the church of Granas.  As the story goes, 10,000 years ago a battle between Granas and Valmar was waged and the battle was long fought.  Valmar was slain, but now it appears that he may yet rise again.  At first Ryudo is uninterested in any of this, only looking at this as a job.  But as the two travel together and meet new allies they soon learn that there's much more to the legend behind Granas and Valmar and that the church may, in fact, be hiding something.  As you can imagine, Elena is the key. In terms of story, Grandia II doesn't hold a candle up to the first.  While the first was slow to hit the ground running, the story ended up being a much more unique take on an old formula making it that much more engaging.  Along with having lighthearted characters.  Grandia II, on the other hand, is much more formulaic in its approach.  Where as Justin was a lighthearted boy just looking for adventure; Ryudo is a brazen character who is something of a loner.  This was no doubt inspired by the fact that the most popular JRPG characters of the time were characters like Cloud and Squall.  In other words... the character with \"attitude\" was just the more popular trope.  It makes for a tough introduction to Ryudo at first as Grandia II plays the attitude and apathetic mercenary angle a little too strongly at first... but he develops incredibly well becoming and overall good character that you'll really love by the end of the game.  The rest of the cast is pretty much the same way.  Each one beginning as a standard trope at first but becoming something more.  In the end while the cast isn't as memorable as the first game, they're certainly not forgettable. The same can't be said about the writing.  As with many JRPGs of the past, the dialog does not always age well.  The voice acting is sometimes rather flat, but what is more annoying is how typical most of the dialog in Granida II is.  Were it not for the characters within the story, Grandia II would come off as a \"by the book\" type of JRPG--even upon it's original release.  There's nothing surprising or unpredictable about the story at all.  There are twists and turns, but because of the formulaic approach you'll never find yourself guessing for long just what the next twist will be.  At least the characters make for a more engaging story.  Their conversations with one another more than make up for the predictability as the game is pretty big on showing you just how much they care about each other.  But more importantly, it's how the characters grow and change throughout.  This, in the end, makes Grandia II's story truly rewarding. The Grandia series is well known for its battle system.  A little mix of active time and turn based battling, Grandia II still feels complex.  Every character moves along an IP gauge, and when you hit a certain point you select an action.  They will begin performing it, but your enemies will be moving at the same time.  Attacks execute themselves immediately while magic or special abilities generally have to be charged up first.  You can strike enemies with a critical hit, thus canceling certain attacks (if doen at the right time) and you can also counter an enemy if your attack gets off before theirs does. There is plenty of magic to learn throughout the game.  You'll often find Mana Eggs which you can equip on characters and utilize the spells.  They often cover a specific range across the battle field.  The more a spell is used, the faster it'll charge up when you select it.  But more rewarding than the spells are each character's special abilities.  Every character has a set of moves to call their own and some come with added perks, such as the ability to cancel enemy attacks.  Like magic, the more you use them the less time they take to charge.  They also become more powerful.  Unlike Magic, however, your abilities don't use MP.  They use Spirit Points (SP).  Spirit points are earned by attacking and being attacked.  They're exceptionally powerful moves that often end most battles quickly. If there were any downside to Grandia II, it would be that the game is ridiculously easy.  At first it seems complex to see the battle system in action, but Grandia II gives the player overly powerful attacks while also making the system easy to take advantage of.  With the ability to cancel and counter so easily, you can get through whole battles (even boss fights) with the enemy never touching you.  Once the player learns the system it becomes a walk in the park to get through.  Nothing will really challenge the player.  There's also not as much emphasis put on grinding, given that there's much less to level up and explore.  Yes, in the long run, Grandia II is actually much smaller than the first game.  There are fewer spells, it's a shorter quest, there are fewer abilities and it's a lot more straightforward.  The dungeons are smaller and push you through.  In a way some of this is good.  In the first Grandia it was a lot easier to get lost and it caused the story to sometimes move at a slower pace.  Grandia II progresses by much faster, not keeping you in the same area for very long.  And while there aren't as many spells or as much customization, Grandia II is still solid from a gameplay stand point. Visually Grandia II is a pretty stunning Dreamcast game.  It's got lots of colors and details and also moves at a pretty good framerate.  It really shows off just how awesome the Dreamcast is.  There are some games that came out that look better--some even at launch (Soul Calibur) and some that came a little later (Skies of Arcadia) but Grandia II definitely holds its own.  The music is pretty solid too.  The game's battle themes in particular are catchy.  The voice acting might use some work but it's not going to make you want to turn the volume down either. Grandia II was ported to the PS2 and the PC in 2002.  This was how I first experienced Grandia II.  I was pretty impressed with it then, but now that I've played the original Dreamcast version... I'd very much have to recommend the Dreamcast version much more so.  The PS2 version suffers from steep dips in frame rate as well as flickering textures  and no where near as much polish.  While this may not sound big, on a technical level some of it is.  Particularly the frame rate dips.  When there's too much going on at any one point in time you may find that Ryudo and company run in slow motion.  The Dreamcast version, by comparison, moves a lot smoother, animations are better and you don't have to worry about flickering textures.  If you have a choice between the PS2 and Dreamcast version, go with the Dreamcast.  Certainly the PS2 has an added scene or two, but the Dreamcast version still tells a very coherent story without them.  The only reason to play the PS2 version over the Dreamcast one is if you have absolutely no way of getting a hold of the Dreamcast version of the game. Grandia II is not a perfect game.  It doesn't strive to go above and beyond the competition the way the first one does, but it's still a really good game to play.  It's got great characters and a really complex and fun battle system.  It's a fun game and one that any fan of the JRPG should give a try.</td><td>The Best the Genre Has to Offer</td><td>1354320000</td><td>1</td><td>1578</td><td>6709</td><td>103</td><td>4.251584283903676</td><td>15.320388349514563</td><td>0.17631243</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</td><td>17548</td><td>4.0</td><td>11</td><td>false</td><td>02 26, 2001</td><td>B00004UE2A</td><td>Lisa Shea</td><td>I still remember when my sister first introduced me to You Don't Know Jack when we were out on Nantucket.

Now, seven years later, I've played it and walked away about underwhelmed. First off the game is butt ugly, but that is expected for a seven-year old game. The textures are blurry and washed out and the character models are down right laughable. No matter though B&W delivers a great style that hasn't been in any other RTS. While the story is paper-thin there really isn't any need of one. You are a God who is just a floating hand and you take control of creatures. These Creatures can help your villagers either farm grain for good, chop down wood for...erm...wood, and you can pet it, slap it around to tell it it's bad, or encourage it to do bad things such as even eating the villagers! The whole premise of B&W is the \"good or evil\" premise that Peter Moloneux oh so loves. The whole concept of the game is to influence other villages by performing God like tasks such as supplying them with food, or wood. You can use your Creature to impress them or you can do evil things to impress them such as picking up the villagers and throwing them around, smashing their buildings etc. When you get a village the people will have needs. These are noted with flags around building. Some may want more houses to breed children. Some may want a wonder, some people may even want more trees or rocks in their village. When you start running out of resources you can perform miracles by having your villagers chant at your temple. You can then use \"gestures\" to use wood miracles, food miracles, fire, or shields to attack or protect villages etc. The game plays out in missions via silver scrolls that require you to help (or hurt) people. When you get the God Stones you unlock the next door to pick your next Creature. While all this sounds astounding (and it is) the game is very hard and gets old really quick. After the first land which is the tutorial land you'll pretty much have seen what the game has to offer. What makes the game so hard is that you will never have enough resources and the resources are very limited, and buildings require too much wood to build. While taking your Creature out on walks using a leash (use the good or bad collar to have the Creature act accordingly) sounds neat it is but not for long. Back in 2001 this kind of thing was like finding a Martian...it didn't exist. In 2008 we've seen this many times before and it's nothing new.

With Tekken Tag Tournament on the PS2, the characters are fluidly smooth, the backgrounds are INCREDIBLE and the combinations of moves for each character both reflect the personality of the fighter and are executed flawlessly on the screen. The Tag Tournament aspect might seem distracting before you've tried it, but in the game it adds another entire strategic layer to how you play. You can choose two players who have opposite skill sets, so that you choose which one to kill off your opponents with. Or, you can choose with matching skills so that you continue to hammer on your foes with a certain style of play. Even better, certain combinations of characters can do a special tag move, so that one player does something on his/her way 'out' and the other character finishes the move while coming into the arena. Very, very cool! And those graphics! Your characters can wear different outfits. The fire in the torches looks like REAL fire - one of the hardest things to do on a computer. The leaves on the ground actually scatter when you slam your enemy into the floor.

One ad said something like: (good) Your loving wife makes you breakfast in bed / (evil) You eat it with your mistress. It made it seem like you'd really have these sorts of decisions to make. Instead, when you play, you have a cutsie little angel and a cuddly little devil, both making fun comments. The devil's comments are always promptly slapped down by the angel. The \"evil\" you do is more like Dungeon Keeper than anything else - drop things on peoples' houses, bug them if they're not doing what you want to do. You only get to start with a choice of three 'creatures', and these creatures have got to be some of the slowest learners on the planet. You tell one to pick up a drowning person, and he pops the person in his mouth and starts eating him!

In TWiNE, you play Bond, James Bond, as he goes through the various stages of the movie. Each mission represents one section of the plot, starting from the banking building in Spain and moving onward. The missions tend to be longer and more drawn out then the movie showed, making the game last far longer than the movie did! The graphics are stellar on this version, a big enhancement from the last two games. Bond is very realistic looking, as are the various people he meets and talks to. You interact with people in a variety of ways, from watching civilians huddle in fear to exchanging witty comments with the bad guys. And, yes, there are times that you have to pull out your P2K and start plugging holes in those who will not listen to reason. While the game does have its shoot-it-out aspects, it is much more than a first-person shooter. It's much more like Thief, where you can find sneaky, non-violent ways around many situations. Want to get into a room? You can run in with guns blazing, taking out anyone who crosses your path. Favor a more thoughtful approach? Try running when the camera is pointing the other way, and ducking into nooks. The tools of the trade are wonderfully done and quite useful. A fingerprint scanner lets you steal fingerprints off a coffee thermos, getting you into restricted areas. Block the metal detector with a spinning gizmo straight out of a sci-fi movie. Don't the guards notice you walking around with this thing? Sometimes it's better not to ask questions. The cut scenes between missions are straight out of the movie, and hints help nudge you through the mission if you choose to use them. There are choices of difficulty, so you can play through on the easier level and then go back for a harder challenge. Playing well also unlocks cheats, so do your best!

It was released for the Sony Playstation in 2000.  While I believe certain things were changed for the worse and really don't think it's as good of a game overall compared to the original, it's a pretty awesome game anyway. Right from the very beginning of the game I notice the storyline is becoming more of a focus than ever before.  In the last game, you had the occasional cutscenes showing actual war footage from World War II, and in between were explanations from your female friend giving you important advice on exactly what you needed to do in order to complete the stages.  In this game, you ARE that female friend from the last game, going around doing lots of soldier shooting and completing objectives.  So your playable character is someone else.  Right there is an indication to me that the series is making small storyline progression steps.  Okay, not a HUGE deal or anything. Before starting the game, you'll notice in the Options menu there's a difficulty setting.  The game automatically has it set to Easy, and believe me, once you start the game you'll see why.  The stages are pretty tough and easy mode is the correct difficulty for a first-time playthrough.  To be completely honest, even on Easy mode this game is probably just as difficult as the last one, maybe even harder.  The first few stages feature guards that are probably just as tough as they were in stages 10 and 11 from the previous Medal of Honor game.  Yikes! If you put the game on Normal mode, you'll only have 50% energy at the beginning of each stage.  On Hard mode, the amount of energy you have left from the previous stage will carry over to the next stage  So yeah, PLAY THE GAME ON EASY!!! I had extremely mixed feelings once the game actually started up.  Why you ask?  Because the very first stage involves you finding your brother, and having you run directly behind him as he guides you through the rest of the level.  To me, that's a sign of a game searching for a storyline change.  While that's all fine and good, what made the original so great was how you were all alone on your missions and had to complete them by yourself.  It kind of bothers me how in the very first level you're supposd to let your brother do all the killing while you stand back and watch.  Of course, you can run past your brother and do all the killing yourself, but I'm not so sure that's a good idea.  The point I'm trying to make is that throwing other people into the game shows signs of the Medal of Honor series moving in a direction involving more focused storylines, and I'm not very fond of that because the series is supposed to be all about shooting, killing, and well, more shooting. Either way, once you complete level one, it seems the one-man army style from the previous game (well in this case, one-WOMAN army) has returned, which means, again it's just you by yourself exploring the stages and blasting guards, just like it was before.  In other words, just how it SHOULD be. It's harder to complete the objectives in this game compared to the original.  I'm not exactly sure why, but it might have something to do with the layout of the stages which feature slightly more narrow hallways and smaller passageways.  This makes it hard to see what's around the next corner soemtimes.  Don't worry though, the stages are about as long as they were before, maybe even longer.  But many times I'm finding in many situations you don't really have as much distance or freedom as you did before.  This means you might walk up to a guard unexpectedly and not even realize it.  Of course this means you will only have a split second to react. Once again, head shots are your best friend.  If you can manage to hit a guard in the head, he will probably fall over and die immediately.  The soldiers look pretty much exactly like they did in the first MoH game.  In fact, there's no changes at all as far as I can see.  They don't seem to be any harder to kill or anything, but they aren't afraid to unleash some mean, nasty weapons on you either! I don't like how this time around there's only a certain amount of ammo you can collect from each stage.  For example, in one stage I couldn't collect any more machine gun bullets because I had 300 bullets and couldn't go past that.  Things like that bother me a little. I'm kind of disappointed the bullets from those big machine guns attached to the ground that you occasionally stumbled upon in the last game are slower this time around.  Believe me, there's more guards in this game when you DO eventually find one of these machine guns, so because of the way the bullets fire slowly, you will probably get hit a lot more while trying to wipe out a group of guards.  I'm actually finding it easier to ignore these stationed machine guns completely and just pull out either MY machine gun, or something else.  It's easier and faster to kill with my weapons for some reason. Speaking of machine guns, what's up with the way your female playable character holds the machine gun in this game?  She holds it to the side like they do in the movies, I guess because it's supposed to look cool, haha. Load times are about the same.  It still takes 15 to 20 seconds to load a stage.  I don't mind it myself.  These stages are fun and exciting, so waiting a few seconds for them to load up isn't a problem for me personally. Loading your progress to a memory card is kind of strange.  Well, maybe it's because my memory card is almost full, but I can't get my file to appear at the very top.  I have to scroll down and search for it.  Also, maybe I'm seeing things, but the framerate doesn't feel quite as fast this time around.  I don't know, there seems to be an ever-so-slight reaction delay when you jump up in the air.  Everything else seems exactly like it was before, though.  You probably won't even notice.  Forget I said anything! Now with all that whining and negativity out of the way, let's talk about why I give the game a near-perfect rating.  The amount of creativity that was involved in making this game is unbelievable.  The level designs are outstanding.  This time around you have daytime stages while walking through sandy areas, and castle stages where you have to deal with guards hiding in armor (head shots will take care of them).  Some returning environments return from the last game such as the nighttime forest levels.  You have more of those in this game, not to mention more challenging ones. The stages are longer and more challenging this time around, because you have to eliminate moving trucks, army tanks and motorcycles.  This is not only a welcome addition for those of you only familiar with the original Medal of Honor, but also a welcome increase in challenge.  I love when I come across a big moving tank and have to find a way to get it to stop moving completely.  Because you're doing more than just running around blasting soldiers, this game can probably be considered more of a realistic wartime experience compared to the previous game. I'd say the stages this time around are more like mazes instead of straight-ahead \"going from room to room\" combat.  A good example is the one forest stage, where multiple paths are present and you have to find out which path leads to where.  You'll be spending more time figuring out where to go and killing soldiers along the way.  Overall, the stages feel longer this time around. The soundtrack is once again incredible.  You'll really feel like you're in the middle of a warzone for the entire time you're playing the game. Either way, this is one really exciting game.  Along with Quake II and the original Medal of Honor, this is the third best first-person shooter on the original Playstation.  An old game that's still worth playing over and over again.  The nonstop shooting action brings me back to it and glues me in every time.  Well that and the fact I like to improve my accuracy every time I play the game.  Those head shots are crucial not only for survival, but also to save on ammunition later on.

I grabbed Kessen the second I got my hands on a PS2, and started playing it immediately. The graphics in the game are startlingly lovely. From the cut-scenes to the campagin setup to the reactions of commanders to your decisions, it truly flows like an interactive movie. It's not just hack-and-slash, either. There are personal triumphs, anguished losses, generals who you convince to join your side, warriors who show their nuances of personality in how they react to your commands. The game is a strategic combat between the two great warlords of the early 1600s, recreating a series of battles that put an end to the fighting era and brought in over 200 years of peace. The level of detail is great. You can see exactly how each group is put together, the loyalty of each leader, their weariness, and much more. You can choose to ignore details if you want, but a true strategist will find ways to shine by taking them all into consideration. You can also use political influence to sway your enemies, and sometimes they'll even watch how the battle goes for a while before determining which side to take. The cut-scenes are beautiful, but if you want to skip them, just hit a button and you're back into the overall battle watching. Perhaps the only downside is that since this is based on real events, you don't have as much flexibility as in a game that could randomly create situations and encounters. Perhaps this same engine might be used for that in the coming months!</td><td>Kessen Shines on the PS2</td><td>986169600</td><td>1</td><td>280</td><td>1294</td><td>14</td><td>4.621428571428571</td><td>20.0</td><td>0.14772727</td><td>862</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>18125</td><td>2.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>09 1, 2012</td><td>B00004WFRN</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Alone In the Dark 4: The New Nightmare is actually only rated so low because of how amazingly similar it is to Capcom's classic Resident Evil 2.  Not just a slight similarity either, but rather strikingly identical.  Let's see, a man and woman both forced into a creepy location.  Check.  They both discover unusual and unexplainable monsters.  Check.  They both communicate through a radio.  Check.  They both go around searching for clues to understand the oddness around them.  Check.  Preset camera angles that made the classic RE series popular on the Playstation.  Check. You see, this is basically a continuation of Resident Evil 2.  Maybe, and this is perhaps a really big stretch, this game would appeal to those who didn't think RE2 was anything to write home about.  However Alone in the Dark 4: The New Nightmare is such a blatant imitation of what I consider the real thing that it's hard for me to approach it with open arms and accept it knowing what Resident Evil 2 is a better accomplishment. As for the enemies, the dogs look exactly like dobermans from the RE series, monsters that resemble the slow-paced movements of zombies from the RE series that creep around hallway corners in a similar fashion, and monsters that resemble drain deimos from... you can probably guess by this point, the RE series!  Impossible to believe such a clear ripoff managed to make it to the store shelves.  In a way the soundtrack resembles Silent Hill in the creepiness and even surpasses the Resident Evil series in the freak-out department, but otherwise just stick with Resident Evil 2 for the best survival horror experience.  It's like Resident Evil with way less action and more focus on the atmosphere and storyline.</td><td>alone in the closet where the dust bunnies take over</td><td>1346457600</td><td>0</td><td>308</td><td>1415</td><td>22</td><td>4.5941558441558445</td><td>14.0</td><td>-0.12172349</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>18131</td><td>3.0</td><td>0</td><td>false</td><td>10 23, 2014</td><td>B00004W4QJ</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Parasite Eve II is such a hard game to rate.  It does a few things better than the first Parasite Eve but I admittedly have to mention also does a few things worse.  As a result it's a hard game to judge! Well one thing that absolutely makes me lower a star is the constant backtracking over the same areas over and over.  It's not like the game has much variety to begin with- you have a small town desert and a really enormous facility with a few outdoor areas and several underground sections all linked together.  Granted the facility in particular is split into several different sections and makes up most of the second half of the game, but it's not enough.  While the puzzles are sort of lame (picking up a key and moving it with a magnet is annoying, but not NEARLY as bad as a flippin' block puzzle later on) there aren't really that many of them, so I have no reason to complain about the puzzles overall. Backtracking aside, the music is a mixed bag.  It's actually not much worse than the music in the first Parasite Eve contrary to what others think.  At least this time the music feels appropriate for the environments you're in, however the notes themselves are often times ambient-focused. There's a certain detective-like theme that plays occasionally during conversational moments that's actually a high point for me due to its memorable ambience.  This is the kind of song that goes undetected (no pun intended!) by most gamers.  The desert music however leaves a LOT to be desired- it sounds like a guy learning to play a guitar so he strums the same few notes over and over again and plays *nothing* else.  However it does capture a lonely secluded mood which is nice.  The organ music in a light plant room is really mesmerizing too.  Overall the music is tolerable enough, and to its credit often times the music's not immediately memorable but eventually you begin to notice how good it is the more you're exposed to it.  I can't quite criticize the music and put it a notch lower than the original Parasite Eve's soundtrack knowing it has the potential to grow on players overtime like it has grown on me. The enemy variety is really good.  Now the mutated vicious creatures actually show intimidation.  I remember in the first Parasite Eve the enemies were often times laughably out of place (bears on the city streets anyone or how about the giant bugs?) but now you have blob-like grunting creatures that pose a threat, alien/lizard monsters that make passing them a fearful and reluctant decision, crazy overlarge camel creatures with evil grins, several insects and security cameras everywhere, and even tiny pink babies crawling out from under the bed of the desert hotel rooms.  Now THAT last one is absolutely crazy!  Also often times while you're returning to previous areas, enemies will respawn which isn't necessarily a good thing since it makes them less dangerous/threatening. The dialogue takes a MAJOR blow here- it's no longer spoken.  You have to read it on screen now.  As a result the characters are less interactive and feel MUCH less imaginative.  Aya's still incredibly attractive of course, but she's not as interesting now.  Even worse, you don't care about the storyline as much as you did in the first Parasite Eve where emotions from the characters were distinctly noticeable.  It was a devastating blow not to include any voice acting here.  It was so good in the first Parasite Eve too- the sequel totally deserve to continue this trend.  This means anything your main character Aya says related to the evil demon Eve and the mitochondria virus feels less significant now since conversations are no longer spoken.  Not just that, but if you were to take the dialogue and separate it from everything else, you'll notice the storyline just isn't as gripping or creative as it was in the first game either.  Talk about dropping the ball. Also, whereas the original Parasite Eve had many interesting pre-rendered backgrounds and static camera angles, this game practically wants to be the next Resident Evil 2 in particular with the more up close static camera shots featuring identical angles and environments to the ones you'd find in the Dino Crisis or old school Resident Evil series.  The graphics, gloomy setting, startling similar facility environments, gunshots, gun variety, enemy deaths, ominous atmosphere... this game is a LOT like RE2 but perhaps due to how much backtracking is involved, the atmosphere eventually loses its meaning.  Unnecessary length is this games biggest downfall. Now let's talk about the good shall we?  Despite strong resembling Resident Evil 2, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  It means Parasite Eve 2 resembles classic survival horror.  This means Parasite Eve 2 is still much scarier than most games released nowadays under the survival horror tag.  Also while the cutscenes are less dramatic, shocking and noteworthy for the most part (darn, I miss the people burning alive in the opera house!) there's a few REALLY intense moments such as a big monster appearing outside a hotel room in the desert at night with earthquake effects adding to his frightening appearance and desire for killing.  This scene is totally fitting for a War of the Worlds movie, haha!  INCREDIBLY scary!  This scene/battle alone makes me want to play the game some more! The game shares the same number system as the first Parasite Eve.  When you attack enemies you'll see a number appear over their bodies indicating how much damage you've inflicted.  I like this feature and wish the Resident Evil games had done the same thing, even though it'd probably be useless since most zombies have a similar amount of health and it's not like the RE games on the PS1 take very long to complete anyway- maybe 2-4 hours.  It's just not necessary to include a number system in the RE games.  Parasite Eve and Parasite Eve 2 are guaranteed to take several hours until you reach the end. Overall, well it's an alright game.  It tells a decent story (the ending's terrible though- sorry but it is man!) but the flaws are everywhere and the game gets boring after a while.  Trying to be like Resident Evil was a costly decision I think.  Not a bad game however, but the first one is clearly more compelling due to the unforgettably awesome cutscenes, more interesting/creative storyline, better character development and interaction, shock value, etc.</td><td>less appealing... or not?</td><td>1414022400</td><td>0</td><td>1133</td><td>5277</td><td>50</td><td>4.657546337157988</td><td>22.66</td><td>-0.002556787</td><td>359</td></tr><tr><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>18163</td><td>4.0</td><td>4</td><td>false</td><td>10 11, 2001</td><td>B00004WFZQ</td><td>N.
